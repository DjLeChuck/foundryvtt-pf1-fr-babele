			"description": "<p>Alchemists are not only masters of creating mundane alchemical substances such as alchemist’s fire and smokesticks, but also of fashioning magical potion-like extracts in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power—this enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the effects to the creator.<br><br>When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the Craft (alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using&nbsp;detect magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.<br><br>An alchemist can create three special types of magical items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.<br><br>Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by effects like @Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}&nbsp;using the alchemist’s level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though, extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a potion normally could not.<br><br>An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table 2–1. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.<br><br>When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the alchemist’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery below). An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work—most alchemists prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but it’s not uncommon for an alchemist to keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.<br><br>Although the alchemist doesn’t actually cast spells, he does have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?Class=Alchemist\">formulae list</a>&nbsp;that determines what extracts he can create. An alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on his formuale list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses Use Magic Device to do so). An extract is “cast” by drinking it, as if imbibing a potion—the effects of an extract exactly duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist. An alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level.<br><br>Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement).<br><br>An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.<br><br>An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings before copying them.</p>"

This bond can take one of two forms: a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;bonded object. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;is a magical pet that enhances the wizard’s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a&nbsp;bonded object&nbsp;is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\" rel=\"nofollow\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>\n<p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard’s level. This spell cannot be modified by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard’s opposition schools (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-School\">arcane school</a>&nbsp;below).</p>\n<p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a> and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see @Compendium[pf1.feats.4hNO4OAWYF5vXphH]{Craft Magic Arms and Armor}&nbsp;feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object’s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p>\n<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>"

Instead, she seeks out the aid of a small group (such as a party of adventurers) as a result of an obscure vision or other influence from the Dark Tapestry that she might not fully comprehend. More often, though, a Dark Tapestry shaman is encountered not as a member of a group, but as the leader of a cult in a remote region—these shamans, of course, work best as NPC villains and not as PCs.</em><br><br><em>The spirits of the Dark Tapestry have often been known to whisper dangerous secrets to mortals who dwell on sane worlds. Such spirits might be found anywhere touched by the light of baleful stars, but they are most frequently found lurking around unfathomably ancient ruins of aberrant civilizations with links to the Dark Tapestry. On Golarion, these spirits can often be found near old ruins in Osirion or the Sodden Lands, although they are also quite active throughout the county of Versex in Ustalav. Many shamans who invoke the spirits of the Dark Tapestry also worship one or several of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos, be it out of fear or misinformed adoration. Other entities associated with the Dark Tapestry, particularly the Dominion of the Black, seem less likely to be associated with that realm’s spirits, so it may well be that the spirits that shamans call upon when they turn to the Dark Tapestry for power are in fact the idle thoughts of horrors such as Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, or even Azathoth.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Magic Spells:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.ja005kj1gh7g0dnk]{Entropic Shield} (1st),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.gl524v9qd5jji2ex]{Contact Entity I} (2nd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.6g7x08y9nl7vlffv]{Contact Entity II} (3rd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.wralcmyi4tdcai24]{Black Tentacles} (4th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.0n789r9rokr1ktd1]{Contact Entity III} (5th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.66vvhyiy5q8yzbq2]{Feeblemind} (6th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.6kn3xjxysd4b3t6a]{Contact Entity IV} (7th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.s6q72tw2zra9sycu]{Insanity} (8th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.4qriqew7d2ot7wr5]{Interplanetary Teleport}&nbsp;(9th).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Spirit Animal:</strong> The shaman’s spirit animal has an alien physiology, including twitching tentacles, additional but blind eyes, or strangely deformed limbs.

Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Gunslinger Deeds:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Deadeye (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm’s first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the –2 penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger’s Dodge (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a> to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p><em>Quick Clear (Ex):</em> At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the gunslinger can remove the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks. Furthermore, if she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p><em>Pistol-Whip (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger’s size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check to knock the target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p><em>Utility Shot (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blast Lock:</em> The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">Arcane lock</a>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/knock\">knock</a>&nbsp;can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">arcane lock</a>&nbsp;can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li><em>Scoot Unattended Object: </em>The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot’s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>\n<li><em>Stop Bleeding: </em>The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Dead Shot (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;as she can, based on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>. She makes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;hit the target, the gunslinger’s single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;–5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p><em>Startling Shot (Ex): </em>At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p><em>Targeting (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets.

When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Axiomatic\">axiomatic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Brilliant-Energy\">brilliant energy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Defending\">defending</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption/\">disruption</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming-Burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Holy\">holy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Merciful\">merciful</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Speed\">speed</a>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost (see&nbsp;Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities). These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.</p>\n<p>The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse (for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin), although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>, using the paladin’s level as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;of at least 6.</p>\n<p>In addition to horses, a paladin may select (at the GM’s discretion) some less ordinary creatures.</p>\n<p>A Medium paladin can select an elk, giant seahorse, giraffe, yak,&nbsp;or zebra&nbsp;as a bonded mount.</p>\n<p>A Small paladin can select an antelope, capybara, eohippus, giant weasel, ram, reindeer, stag, or wolfdog&nbsp;as a bonded mount.</p>\n<p>The auspice, bodyguard, racer, and totem guide archetypes are all particularly appropriate for a paladin’s bonded mount.</p>\n<p>Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin’s level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, the mount gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/celestial-creature-cr-special\">celestial creature simple template</a>&nbsp;and becomes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast\">magical beast</a>&nbsp;for the purposes of determining which spells affect it.</p>\n<p>At 15th level, a paladin’s mount gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to the paladin’s level + 11.</p>\n<p>Should the paladin’s mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first.

			"description": "<p>A vigilante hides his true identity, allowing him to move about social circles and nobility without carrying the stigma of his ruthless actions. In effect, the vigilante has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante’s true identity revealed to the world at large.<br><br>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante’s secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user’s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.<br><br>Despite being a single person, a vigilante’s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity’s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante’s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.<br><br>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>"

If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again.

The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit’s effects early as a swift action.

If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target’s magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir’s maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target’s life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target’s ability to use magic, the tongue’s unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.</p>"

Each implement school adds one spell per spell level of that school of magic to the occultist’s spell list. No spells from any other school are considered to be on the occultist’s spell list until he selects the associated implement school. He can’t use spell trigger or spell completion magic items from unknown schools without succeeding at the appropriate Use Magic Device check.

Every day, the occultist selects one item from that school’s list to be his implement for the day for each implement school he knows. The occultist needs only one such item to cast spells of the corresponding school, unless he selected that implement school multiple times, in which case he needs one item for each set of spells gained from that school. Implements don’t need to be magic items, and nonmagical implements don’t take up a magic item slot even if they’re worn. Implements that are not magic items are often of some historical value or of personal significance to the occultist, such as the finger bone of a saint, the broken scepter of a long-dead king, the skull of a mentor’s familiar, or the glass eye of an uncanny ancestor.<br><br>Whenever an occultist casts a spell, he must have the corresponding implement in his possession and present the implement to the target or toward the area of effect. This act is part of casting the spell and doesn’t require any additional action. If the occultist lacks the corresponding implement, he can attempt to cast the spell, but must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell’s level) to do so. Spells cast by an occultist without the appropriate implement are always treated as if they were cast at the minimum caster level for the spell in question (caster level 1st for a 1st-level spell, caster level 4th for a 2nd-level spell, and so on).<br><br>Each implement school also grants a base focus power. This power is added to the list of focus powers possessed by the occultist.

The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider’s Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp.

The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if the alchemist succumbs to a mental effect that would make him unconscious, helpless, or not in control of his own actions (such as @Compendium[pf1.spells.tjog6bufg5b08lvq]{Charm Person}, @Compendium[pf1.spells.66vvhyiy5q8yzbq2]{Feeblemind}, or @Compendium[pf1.spells.78kwl5t99j9e8tzh]{Hold Person}), he can reroll his saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can ignore it. Using this ability sickens the alchemist for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and he cannot use the twin’s limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally.</p>\n<p>The alchemist must have selected the vestigial arm discovery twice before selecting this discovery.</p>"

When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist’s consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can’t return to the spiritualist’s consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.<br><br>While fully manifested, a phantom can’t be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of&nbsp;dispel magic, but spells such as&nbsp;dismissal&nbsp;and&nbsp;banishment&nbsp;work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist’s consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can’t return to the spiritualist’s consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can’t be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist’s consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist’s psyche.<br><br>Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist’s consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.<br><br>Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom’s master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist’s consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.<br><br>A fully manifested phantom’s abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist’s class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels.&nbsp;</p>"

While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.<br><br><strong>Becoming Ronin:</strong> Normally, when a samurai wishes to change his order, he must undergo a lengthy process that requires him to adhere to the edicts of his new order for a period of time before receiving any benefits. This is not the case with ronin. Once a samurai decides to become a ronin, he immediately loses all of the bonuses, skills, and abilities of his old order and gains those of the ronin order. If he wishes to once again dedicate himself to another order, he must do so using the normal rules.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> Ronin follow their own personal code of ethics and honor. As such, their edicts are extremely flexible and subject to change. Each ronin should determine his own edicts, which should include at least three provisions. These edicts are subject to GM approval.<br><br><strong>Challenge: </strong>Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level).<br><br><strong>Skills: </strong>A ronin adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills.</p>"

In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water.</p>\n<p>If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile.
