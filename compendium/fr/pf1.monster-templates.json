		"Alter Ego": {
			"name": "Alter Ego",
			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>An alter ego arises when a sliver of a creature’s personality breaks free and coalesces into an independent being. An alter ego is almost always formed by accident rather than by design, and usually comes into being during a moment of trauma, disorientation, or sudden incapacitation. In many cases, the progenitor isn’t aware that the alter ego was created, particularly if the new creature hides or flees rather than confronting its progenitor immediately.<br><br>An alter ego’s body is made not of flesh and blood, but of solidified ectoplasm that looks, smells, and feels like its progenitor’s body. Because ectoplasm is less dense than bone or carapace, an alter ego weighs less and is more nimble than its progenitor. Although an alter ego appears similar to its progenitor, it speaks in a flat monotone and its eyes stare blankly out of a numb, expressionless face. Observers find an alter ego’s behavior and expressions doll-like and off-putting. A creature familiar with the progenitor can identify the alter ego as a duplicate with a successful Perception check (opposed by the alter ego’s Disguise check) or with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. As an alter ego looks very similar to its progenitor, it can easily engender confusion or cause harm to its progenitor’s reputation. If the alter ego of a famous paladin is spotted fleeing from danger, for example, witnesses might call the paladin’s courage into question. Rumors of uncharacteristic actions might be the progenitor’s first indication that an alter ego is at large.<br><br>An alter ego’s psyche is both more limited and more focused than the mind of its progenitor. Although the alter ego has all of the progenitor’s memories and abilities at the time of its creation (including any prepared spells), its personality revolves around a single facet of its progenitor’s psyche that drives the alter ego’s actions. This facet is often a personality aspect that the progenitor prefers to keep hidden but that leapt to the fore during the event that caused the alter ego’s creation. For example, a cleric who secretly grapples with doubt might spawn a staunchly atheist alter ego, or an alchemist who occasionally swindles an adventurer or traveler to keep up with the rent on her shop might engender an openly and unrepentantly greedy alter ego. Stories abound of murderous alter egos, but in truth only a rare few alter egos have facets that provoke extreme activities such as munificence or violence. Alter egos are generally dispassionate in their actions and neutral in alignment; the greatest danger most pose is to their progenitors’ reputations and peace of mind.<br><br>An alter ego’s mind fixates on its sole purpose, and it is rarely idle. It actively and even obsessively pursues short-term goals based on its dominating facet. For example, an alter ego that came into being when its progenitor was disgraced might seek out and humiliate those who witnessed the event, while one with a murderous facet that formed during a botched getaway might engage in a string of massacres. Because these intentions spring from a limited aspect of the progenitor’s personality, an alter ego’s schemes often conflict with the progenitor’s overall goals. For example, the progenitor of the vengeful alter ego might wish to forget the event that created it ever happened, while the alter ego’s actions revive gossip about the unfortunate occurrence; if the murderous alter ego sprang from a progenitor who was a methodical, disciplined assassin, the alter ego’s reckless killing spree is likely to interfere with the assassin’s well-laid plans.<br><br>Regardless of the alter ego’s personality facet and how it was created, it loathes its progenitor. In some cases, the alter ego might merely find its progenitor to be abrasive. Most alter egos do not initially plan to kill their progenitors, but the idea may come to them while in their progenitors’ presences, spurred by their instinctual hatred, and alter egos spawned from self-loathing or suicide attempts may actively plot to ruin or assassinate their progenitors. Despite this revulsion, an alter ego continually receives mental flashes of its progenitor’s location and is debilitated when its progenitor is more than a mile away. When in its progenitor’s immediate presence, an alter ego cannot help but recognize its progenitor and overhear snatches of the progenitor’s surface thoughts. If the progenitor is dead, the alter ego gains considerable freedom to pursue its activities—a realization some alter egos come to over many days, weeks, or years— and that realization drives such alter egos to eventually murder their progenitors, or else plot to replace them and keep their wayward originals somewhere quiet and peaceful.<br><br>Certain psychic or magic items (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Mirror%20of%20Opposition\">mirror of opposition</a>) can create a copy of a creature. The alter ego template works well for generating such a creature and is particularly appropriate for a copy of a psychic spellcaster or another psychically sensitive individual. Depending on the effect that created the copy, it may be either a duplicate or an opposite. Unlike standard alter egos, duplicates usually have the same alignment as their progenitors, while opposites have the diametrically opposite alignment.<br><br>An alter ego is an artificial creature. It has no need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and rarely takes the time to do so unless it is actively masquerading as a living creature.<br><br>It is identical in size to its progenitor, but weighs only two-thirds as much.<br><br>“Alter ego” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature that has an Int score of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An alter ego uses all of the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>Same as base creature.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Usually neutral.<br><br><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to construct. It retains all subtypes except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Though it appears identical to its progenitor, an alter ego is formed from a solidified ectoplasm that is more yielding than flesh. Reduce the creature’s natural armor bonus by 2 (minimum +0).<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As a construct, an alter ego doesn’t have a Constitution score, but as a construct it gains bonus hit points based on its size.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An alter ego gains fast healing 1 (or fast healing 3 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), DR 5/adamantine (or DR 10/adamantine if it has 11 Hit Dice or more), and the standard construct immunities and traits.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> An alter ego retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the alter ego’s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Dex +4. As a construct, an alter ego has no Constitution score; treat it as having a Constitution score of 10 when determining hit points, save DCs, and other statistics that rely on a Constitution score.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> An alter ego gains Toughness as a bonus feat.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An alter ego can confuse onlookers into believing it is its progenitor. An alter ego gains a +4 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as its progenitor.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An alter ego gains the following special qualities.<br><br><strong>Progenitor Dependence (Su):</strong> An alter ego is nauseated whenever it is more than 1 mile from the original creature of which it is a copy, so long as the original creature is alive.<br><br><strong>Replicated Gear (Su):</strong> An alter ego has a copy of each item of clothing and equipment (including any magic items other than single- or limited-use items such as wands, scrolls, and potions) that was in its progenitor’s possession at the moment when the alter ego was created. This equipment is fabricated of ectoplasm held in place by the alter ego’s mental energy. This equipment operates as normal for the alter ego. One round after leaving the alter ego’s possession (or 1 round after the alter ego is destroyed), this fabricated equipment dissolves into a thin, silvery mucus.<br><br><strong>Sense Progenitor (Su):</strong> An alter ego creature knows the direction and distance to the original creature of which it is a copy. This sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. An alter ego has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20thoughts\">detect thoughts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=true%20seeing\">true seeing</a>&nbsp;against its progenitor in effect at all times (CL 20th); these abilities cannot be dispelled.</p>"

Traditionally, only one animal lord for a specific animal species is active on a world at any one time, although sometimes, when an extant animal lord strays from its charge or otherwise fails, the force that created it might create a replacement to send against the fallen animal lord to challenge it in a combat to the death, with the victor claiming the right to rule or a chance at redemption.<br><br>An animal lord does not dwell among humanity—the wild is its domain. How an animal lord interacts with a humanoid society largely depends on how that society treats the animals of that lord’s affinity.

			"name": "Animus Shade",
			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>The typical intelligent mind exists as a war of aspects— primitive survival urges and base wants opposing intellectual reason and high-minded goals. Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature’s personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects a creature would normally control and suppress. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects—the creature’s animus—behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.<br><br>Animus shades always bear a superficial resemblance to their former, living selves, but manifest in death as wild brutes, made powerful by their anger and feral by their long suffering. They often appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches, and can sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, severed (but still present) body parts, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items the creature had appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though it may carry ghostly versions of the weapons it used in life, deadly implements still capable of harming the living.<br><br>Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life—whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades have greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments they achieved in life, taking pleasure in destroying those things they once loved or took pride in.<br><br>Because they’re created through psychic violence, animus shades usually appear among intelligent races and beings known for mastering occult forces. Among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess. They’re easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead—often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value physical strength over mental prowess and in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which seldom give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never return as animus shades.<br><br>Poisoned by the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves—they know it was their own weaknesses or distraction that resulted in their deaths. Much of their rage is thus pointed inward, and they take particular satisfaction in viciously unleashing their hatred on those who resemble them, especially if the resulting conflicts remind them of the battles in which they died.<br><br>“Animus shade” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 6 and an Intelligence score of at least 8.

These are mind-affecting effects.<br><br><strong>Animus Insinuation (Sp):</strong> When an animus shade touches a creature, it inspires that creature’s animus to rise up and overthrow the creature’s personality. This effect functions as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=id%20insinuation%20II\">id insinuation II</a>&nbsp;if the animus shade’s CR is 7 or less or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=id%20insinuation%20IV\">id insinuation IV</a>&nbsp;if the animus shade’s CR is 8 or higher, except that either way, the effect targets only a single creature touched and the duration is 1 round per Hit Die of the animus shade, without the need for concentration.<br><br><strong>Corrupt Intent (Su):</strong> An animus shade subverts the intent and willpower of its enemies, filling them with doubt and conflicting desires that play into the animus shade’s hands. Anytime a creature strikes the animus shade with a melee or ranged attack, it must succeed at a Will save or take a –1 penalty on all further attacks against the animus shade for 1d4 rounds. Each subsequent failed save against this ability by a creature already under its effect increases the total penalty by 1 and extends the duration of the effect by 1 round.<br><br><strong>Rend Psyche (Su): </strong>As a standard action, an animus shade can unleash a jet of dark energy at a creature within 30 feet. On a successful ranged touch attack, the target is wracked with mental agony as its own animus attempts to wrench free from its physical form. This violent struggle deals a number of d4s of damage equal to the animus shade’s CR, as well as 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the Charisma damage.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Cha +4. In addition, as an incorporeal creature, an animus shade has no Strength or Constitution score.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An animus shade gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate and Perception checks (which stacks with other racial bonuses). An animus shade treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, its skills are the same as those of the base creature.</p>"

Dangerous and evil fungal creatures rise to power in these blighted reaches, such as sinister&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fungus%20Queen\">fungus queens</a> or legions of undead spore zombies, but when fey creatures become infused with this corruption and are themselves blighted, the resulting monstrosities are particularly vile.<br><br>The typical Abyssal blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are often the most insidious of these corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace— and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own bonded trees.<br><br>Only magic such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=miracle\">miracle</a>,<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=%20limited%20wish\">&nbsp;limited wish</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=wish\">wish</a>&nbsp;can sever the connection to the Abyss and cure a blighted fey, restoring the creature to its uncorrupted state if it fails to resist the transformation with a successful Will saving throw against the spell in question. Of course, once the blight takes hold, a fey creature is corrupted not only in body but in mind as well, and any attempts to cure such a fey creature are bound to be met with violence.<br><br>The process of creating a blighted fey can vary. In some cases, the transformation requires a new fey creature to be bound in blighted fungal tendrils and to languish within the corrupted region for 24 hours, but in other cases the blight might affect a creature almost instantaneously. The potential to resist such corruption with a successful saving throw varies, as does the DC to resist such an effect.

In fact, blights often see the advance of an Abyssal incursion into their natural territory as much of an affront as the encroachment of mortal civilization, and in such cases those who oppose either group can sometimes find allies in the enemies of their enemy. Blights are usually the more difficult of the two to reach an accord with, but one should always tread with caution when dealing with the blighted fey.<br><br>“Blighted fey” is an acquired template that can be added to any fey creature with 2 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A blighted fey uses the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic evil.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A blighted fey gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if the base creature did not already have it. If the base creature already has darkvision, the ability is extended by an additional 30 feet.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by 2.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A blighted fey gains DR 10/cold iron and good; immunity to disease, paralysis, poison, and polymorph; and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.

The infected tree does not need to be specifically bonded to the blighted fey for this ability to function.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A blighted fey gains the following special attacks. Unless otherwise noted, save DCs are equal to 10 + half the blighted fey’s Hit Dice + the blighted fey’s Constitution modifier.<br><br><em>Parasitic Bond (Su):</em> Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack (see below), the blighted fey can transform the thorns into a single burrowing, wriggling maggot that infests and infuses the target with a short-term curse from within unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. This parasite creates an unholy link to the target, binding it to the blighted fey. This binding persists for 5 rounds, during which half of any hit point damage taken by the blighted fey is dealt to the linked target instead. The type of damage remains consistent with the damage dealt to the blighted fey. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one creature at a time. This bond is a curse and a disease effect.<br><br><em>Thorn Throw (Ex):</em> A blighted fey can shoot a fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a standard action. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a sting natural attack, with damage based on the blighted fey’s size (1d4 for a Medium fey), except the attack is resolved as a thrown ranged attack instead of a melee attack. Thorn throw is always a primary attack.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A blighted fey gains the following special qualities.<br><br><em>Blighted Unity (Su):</em> Blighted fey within 100 feet of one other can communicate through a shared fungal mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each other’s senses, but they can share specific situational information and tactics through telepathy. If one blighted fey within range is aware of danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be surprised.<br><br><em>Daughter of the Blight (Su)</em>: Fey creatures who normally have close ties to a specific plant gain this specific quality. For example, blighted fey&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dryad\">dryads</a>&nbsp;are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A dryad’s tree dependent special ability is modified (but not replaced) so blighted fey dryads are required only to remain within 300 yards of any blighted tree. This ability applies only to dryads and other fey who bond with plants in a similar manner.<br><br><em>Tainted Blood (Ex):</em> A blighted fey’s blood and flesh are rife with disease. Any creature that deals damage with a bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save (as per Special Attacks above) or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the affected creature must succeed at a second save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage.

Tortured to the extremes of both physical and mental endurance, and then taken beyond those barriers, a broken soul gains extraordinary reserves of fortitude and resilience as well as the ability to inflict a measure of its own terrible suffering on others.<br><br>Each broken soul has a unique appearance, the torture it has endured plainly visible on its body. Its skin is a mass of scar tissue, marred with bruises that do not fade and scored with countless scars. In some cases, a broken soul’s flesh has been flayed away, revealing the musculature and bone underneath. Weeping sores and open cuts cover a broken soul’s body, wounds that never fully heal. Its limbs are often twisted, the result of broken bones that were never set properly, and it might be missing fingers, toes, ears, or other appendages. A broken soul’s existence is one of unending suffering, and the constant pain often drives the creature irrevocably mad. In their insanity, these unfortunates hate all other creatures and seek to inflict their wounds and their agony on all they encounter.<br><br>The creation of a broken soul can happen in a number of ways. Some broken souls arise spontaneously, the result of horrific treatment at the hands of cruel abusers. With no way to escape their torment, these creatures embrace the pain and anguish and transcend them, making them a part of their very being. In so doing, they become something both more and less than they were. Other broken souls are purposefully created out of helpless prisoners by sadistic torturers through a harrowing gauntlet of mental and physical torments. By breaking a creature’s mind and body, these torturers hope to create guardians or servants whose loyalty is ensured by the constant pain they must endure. Even more harrowing, some broken souls take it upon themselves to create more of their kind, fashioning gruesome works of living, mutilated art in an effort to share their suffering.

All creatures within 120 feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain within 120 feet of the broken soul.

A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space’s feed attack is raised to 1; other ability scores are not altered. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one need only restore all of its drained ability scores to normal.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template&nbsp;</strong>Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Commando constructs are elite fighting machines that often operate alone or in small squads. Although they are skilled combatants, these constructs can handle a variety of clandestine activities, including assassination, infiltration, kidnapping, and sabotage. They are most often found wandering the plains of Numeria, or under the service of a local warlord.<br><br>“Commando construct” is an acquired template that can be added to any construct, referred to hereafter as the base creature.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> If the base creature has 9 or fewer HD, base creature’s CR + 1; if base creature has 10 or more HD, base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> A commando construct gains the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A commando construct’s natural armor bonus increases by 4.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change the commando construct’s Hit Dice to d12s. Additionally, a commando construct gains 1-1/2 times the normal bonus hit points for a construct of its size.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A commando construct gains special attacks chosen from the list below. A commando construct with 8 HD or fewer selects one option, a commando construct with 9–12 HD selects two options, and a commando construct with 13 HD or more selects three options. Each option can be selected only once.<br><br><em>Brutal Attacks (Ex):</em> When a commando construct makes two successful melee attacks against the same target in 1 round, its attacks either rend flesh or crush bones. This deals an additional amount of damage equal to the damage dealt by its highest-damage successful melee attack plus twice the commando construct’s Strength modifier.<br><br><em>Energy Attacks (Su):</em> Pick one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Each of the commando construct’s melee attacks deals 1d6 points of energy damage of the chosen type on a hit.<br><br><em>Extra Attack (Ex):</em> When using the full-attack action, a commando construct can make one extra attack per round at its highest base attack bonus.<br><br><em>Knockdown Strike (Ex): </em>When a commando construct makes a successful melee attack, it can forgo dealing its normal damage to its target and instead attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the construct is successful, the target takes damage equal to the commando construct’s Strength modifier and is knocked prone. This is treated as a trip attack for the purpose of creatures that can’t be tripped or that have bonuses or weaknesses against trip combat maneuvers. On a failed combat maneuver check, the commando construct is not tripped in return. This ability works only on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the commando construct.<br><br><em>Knockout Strike (Ex):</em> As a full-attack action, a commando construct can unleash a devastating strike with one of its melee attacks that can instantly knock a target unconscious. If a commando construct hits and the target takes damage from the attack, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the commando construct’s HD + the commando construct’s Strength modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to regain consciousness. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability.<br><br><em>Precision (Ex):</em> A commando construct rolls twice to confirm critical hits, taking the more favorable result.<br><br><em>Reach (Ex):</em> The reach of all of a commando construct’s melee attacks increases by 5 feet.<br><br><em>Retaliatory Strike (Ex): </em>Whenever an enemy makes a successful melee attack against a commando construct or an adjacent ally, the enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the commando construct.<br><br><em>Sneak Attack (Ex):</em> As per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rogue\">rogue class feature</a>. The number of additional sneak attack dice is based on the commando creature’s Hit Dice.<br><br><em>Sundering Blows (Ex):</em> Whenever a commando construct confirms a critical hit with a melee attack, it deals an amount of damage to the target’s armor or shield equal to the melee damage as if it had also succeeded at a sunder combat maneuver.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +4, Dex +4.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> A commando construct gains one bonus combat feat, plus an additional combat feat for every 4 HD (to a maximum of 10 feats from this ability).<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A commando construct gains following special abilities.<br><br><em>Energized Alacrity (Su):</em> Once per minute as a swift action, a commando construct can draw power from special energizing transmitters attached to its body. When doing so, the commando construct gains a +30-foot bonus to all of its speeds for 1 round. Additionally, when making a full attack during this round, the commando construct can move up to its speed either before or after it attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.<br><br><em>Tactical Awareness (Ex): </em>A commando construct gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 HD the commando construct has (to a maximum of +6 at 20 HD). Additionally, a commando construct is never considered an unaware combatant and is always able to act in the surprise round. A commando construct is still flat-footed in the surprise round until it acts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>A commando construct’s materials cost an additional 10,000 gp above the base creature’s cost. The Craft check required to make the body has a DC 4 higher than normal for the base construct’s kind. The construct is animated using a special laboratory or workroom that costs 1,000 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature’s body, the crafting and the ritual can be performed simultaneously. The creator must have a minimum caster level 1 higher than the base creature’s minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells must be cast during the ritual:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=bull%E2%80%99s%20strength\">bull’s strength</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=heroism,%20greater\">greater heroism</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=limited%20wish\">limited wish</a>.</p>"

While some giant vermin have resisted Deskari’s influence, most have succumbed to it. Such creatures are almost always encountered along the Worldwound’s periphery. As one travels deeper into the blighted land, the immense insects, spiders, and other vermin encountered in the canyons and rivers take on an increasingly unsettling intelligence and demonic features. In many ways, these demonic vermin are no longer true denizens of the Material Plane—they are, after a fact, what happens when the chaos and evil of the Abyss infuse a mindless creature. They are the unholy spawn of vermin—and mortal sins.<br><br>Countless variations of demonic vermin exist in the forbidding wasteland that is the Worldwound. When a nest of similar monsters is encountered, they all typically share the same demonic powers and traits, but another nest of the same species could exhibit entirely different abilities, depending on the nature of the Abyssal energies that have corrupted and transformed them. Uncorrupted giant vermin that wander into or are otherwise brought into the Worldwound do not immediately fall victim to this vile transformation, but several months of exposure can, at the GM’s whim, cause such creatures to spontaneously transform into one of these hideous monstrosities.<br><br>“Demonic vermin” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any vermin (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A demonic vermin retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to magical beast. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. While a demonic vermin is not an outsider, it is treated as if it had the demon subtype for the purposes of resolving all effects relating to that subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities and Defenses:</strong> A demonic vermin gains immunity to electricity and poison and resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10. It also gains DR 5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or DR 10/cold iron (if 12 HD or more). As demonic vermin are intelligent, they lose the mindless trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A demonic vermin’s natural weapons are unchanged, but they are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A demonic vermin retains all the special attacks of the base creature. In addition, it gains one of the following special abilities of your choosing— you can, of course, invent different abilities of your own as well. The save DC for any of these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the demonic vermin’s HD + the demonic vermin’s Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Abyssal Energy (Su): </em>Choose one of the following energy types—acid, fire, or cold. The demonic vermin gains immunity to that energy type, and also gains a breath weapon that inf licts that type of energy damage. This breath weapon is a 60-foot-line, and deals 1d6 points of damage per CR point possessed by the demonic vermin (Reflex save halves). It can be used once every 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Senses (Ex):</em> The vermin has a large number of extra eyes and other sensory organs. It gains all-around vision, scent, and a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks.</p>\n<p><em>Death Throes (Su): </em>When the vermin is slain, it can make a single melee attack (using any one of its natural attacks) as an immediate action. It then explodes into acid, fire, electricity, or cold (your choice), dealing 1d6 points of damage per CR point possessed by the demonic vermin (Ref lex save halves).</p>\n<p><em>Diseased (Su): </em>The demonic vermin is immune to disease, and its natural attacks inflict demonplague (see page 29) on a hit (Fortitude save negates).</p>\n<p><em>Drone (Su): </em>By rubbing its wings or limbs together as a standard action, the demonic vermin produces a loud, discordant drone that causes those within 30 feet of it to become sickened (if the vermin is CR 8 or less) or confused (if the vermin is CR 9 or higher) for 1d6 rounds (Will save negates). This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p><em>Skitter (Ex): </em>The creature has uncanny speed and erratic movements. The vermin’s speeds all increase by 10 feet, it gains Mobility and Spring Attack as bonus feats, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on Initiative checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities: </strong>In addition to gaining one of the special attacks listed here, all demonic vermin gain access to a limited number of spell-like abilities, depending on its Hit Dice. Each ability is usable once per day.

The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can’t hide the details of the contract in any way.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>A devilbound creature has made a bargain with a devil, promising a service and its soul in exchange for infernal power. The specif ic service depends on the devil’s type and motivations, but always furthers the interests of Hell.<br><br>“Devilbound creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with 5 or more Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil. A devilbound creature radiates an evil aura as if it were an evil outsider.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A devilbound creature gains darkvision 60 ft. and the see in darkness ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A devilbound creature gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison, resist fire 30, and regeneration 5 (good spells, good weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>The devil-bound creature gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Contract Bound (Ex): </em>The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can’t hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template’s abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed.<br><br>The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature’s soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil’s belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature’s soul is destroyed, and can’t be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities.<br><br>Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn’t protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil.<br><br>Breaking a contract with a devil is diff icult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can’t be restored to life after death except by a&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as&nbsp;discern location) of the creature responsible.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil remains for 1 hour. The creature’s caster level or Hit Dice, whichever is higher, determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table.<br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Caster Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Devil</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Spell Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Lemure</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bearded devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Erinyes</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bone devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Barbed devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Ice devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> The creature gains the following spell-like abilities, depending on the kind of devil it is bound to.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>A devilbound creature has made a bargain with a devil, promising a service and its soul in exchange for infernal power. The specif ic service depends on the devil’s type and motivations, but always furthers the interests of Hell.<br><br>“Devilbound creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with 5 or more Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil. A devilbound creature radiates an evil aura as if it were an evil outsider.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A devilbound creature gains darkvision 60 ft. and the see in darkness ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A devilbound creature gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison, resist fire 30, and regeneration 5 (good spells, good weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>The devil-bound creature gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Contract Bound (Ex): </em>The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can’t hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template’s abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed.<br><br>The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature’s soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil’s belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature’s soul is destroyed, and can’t be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities.<br><br>Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn’t protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil.<br><br>Breaking a contract with a devil is diff icult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can’t be restored to life after death except by a&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as&nbsp;discern location) of the creature responsible.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil remains for 1 hour.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>A devilbound creature has made a bargain with a devil, promising a service and its soul in exchange for infernal power. The specif ic service depends on the devil’s type and motivations, but always furthers the interests of Hell.<br><br>“Devilbound creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with 5 or more Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil. A devilbound creature radiates an evil aura as if it were an evil outsider.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A devilbound creature gains darkvision 60 ft. and the see in darkness ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A devilbound creature gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison, resist fire 30, and regeneration 5 (good spells, good weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>The devil-bound creature gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Contract Bound (Ex): </em>The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can’t hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template’s abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed.<br><br>The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature’s soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil’s belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature’s soul is destroyed, and can’t be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities.<br><br>Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn’t protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil.<br><br>Breaking a contract with a devil is diff icult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can’t be restored to life after death except by a&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as&nbsp;discern location) of the creature responsible.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil remains for 1 hour. The creature’s caster level or Hit Dice, whichever is higher, determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table.<br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Caster Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Devil</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Spell Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Lemure</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bearded devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Erinyes</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bone devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Barbed devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Ice devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> The creature gains the following spell-like abilities, depending on the kind of devil it is bound to.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br /><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br /><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br /><br />A devilbound creature has made a bargain with a devil, promising a service and its soul in exchange for infernal power. The specif ic service depends on the devil&rsquo;s type and motivations, but always furthers the interests of Hell.<br /><br />&ldquo;Devilbound creature&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with 5 or more Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The creature retains all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil. A devilbound creature radiates an evil aura as if it were an evil outsider.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A devilbound creature gains darkvision 60 ft. and the see in darkness ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A devilbound creature gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison, resist fire 30, and regeneration 5 (good spells, good weapons).</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>The devil-bound creature gains the following weakness.</p>\n<p><em>Contract Bound (Ex): </em>The creature has signed a contract of service in return for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell when it offers a contract, and it can&rsquo;t hide the details of the contract in any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template&rsquo;s abilities, whether immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are completed.<br /><br />The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature&rsquo;s soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies, its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in Hell as one of the devil&rsquo;s belongings. If the devil is dead when the creature dies, the creature&rsquo;s soul is destroyed, and can&rsquo;t be restored to life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not obligated to provide the promised abilities.<br /><br />Many contracts state that the devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature. This doesn&rsquo;t protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil.<br /><br />Breaking a contract with a devil is diff icult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can&rsquo;t be restored to life after death except by a&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;or&nbsp;wish. If the devilbound creature is restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as&nbsp;discern location) of the creature responsible.<br /><br /><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil remains for 1 hour. The creature&rsquo;s caster level or Hit Dice, whichever is higher, determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table.<br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\" /><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\" /></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Caster Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Devil</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Spell Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Lemure</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bearded devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">11th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Erinyes</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Bone devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">15th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Barbed devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">17th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">Ice devil</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\" /><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> The creature gains the following spell-like abilities, depending on the kind of devil it is bound to.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>No<br><br>A divine guardian is a creature chosen by the gods to guard a sacred site of the faith. Blessed with eternal life (or damned, some might say), a divine guardian spends untold centuries in the service of its deity, tirelessly and deathlessly defending its charge from any who would seek to desecrate it.<br><br>Typically such a creature is transformed into a form more regal than its mortal one, setting it apart from a typical member of its race or species. A divine guardian is spiritually connected to the one site that it must guard for eternity. As long as a divine guardian remains within that site, it does not hunger, thirst, get sick, or even age. Within the bounds of its sacred site, a divine guardian possesses numerous defensive powers to ward it from intruders, but it can never leave the area or the long years of its service will finally catch up to it. A divine guardian must weigh the power and prestige of its endless responsibility against the freedom death might inevitably bring.<br><br>Most divine guardians are chosen servants who agree to willingly serve their gods for all eternity, but some have been cursed with their duty in response for some harm to the god’s faithful or as atonement for some great sin. Whatever the nature of its creation, a divine guardian is still beholden to the god that granted it its powers, and to the followers of that god as well.<br><br>A cleric or paladin of the deity that created a divine guardian can issue the guardian commands. This does not give the cleric or paladin complete control over the creature, but the guardian does respond favorably to those requests. For example, a cleric could ask it to not attack her companions, or to help her defend the guardian’s sacred site from attackers. A cleric or paladin of the same faith must win an opposed Charisma check to convince a divine guardian to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. A divine guardian can never be ordered to leave its sacred site or to go against the tenets of its deity’s faith.<br><br>The divine guardian hydra presented here is built using a hydra from the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. See page 178 of the&nbsp;Bestiary&nbsp;for rules on this creature’s hydra traits and regenerate head abilities. This divine guardian hydra is a divine guardian of the god of nature and the weather, thus giving it the air and water subtypes.<br><br>“Divine guardian” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A divine guardian uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Usually, the alignment of a divine guardian matches that of the god who invested it with power. Sometimes, however, a god punishes a wayward worshiper or an enemy of the faith by making it a divine guardian.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type does not change, but the creature might gain one or more alignment or elemental subtypes, depending on the alignment and portfolio of the deity that granted it the template. Possible subtypes include air, chaotic, cold, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, and water. For instance, a lawful good deity’s divine guardian would have the lawful and good subtypes, even if it were actually of some other alignment. Similarly, a neutral god of water and ice would grant its divine guardian the water and cold subtypes.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A divine guardian gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A divine guardian is immune to disease, poison, and all mind-affecting effects. It also gains fast healing 5. In addition, it gains the following defensive ability.</p>\n<p><em>Ability Healing (Ex): </em>A divine guardian heals 1 point of ability damage per round in each damaged ability score.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A divine guardian gains the following.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities: </strong>A divine guardian has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice.

It does not require food, drink, or sleep.</p>\n<p><em>Divine Swiftness (Ex): </em>A divine guardian is gifted with incredible speed, granting it a +4 bonus on initiative rolls. In addition, each of the base creature’s speeds is doubled. If the base creature has a fly speed, the divine guardian’s maneuverability becomes perfect if it was not already. If the divine guardian acquires the air, earth, or water subtype, it gains a fly, burrow, or swim speed equal to its highest speed.</p>\n<p><em>Sacred Site (Ex): </em>Each divine guardian is assigned to guard a specific site sacred to the deity that invested it with power. This area may be a structure, a series of structures, or a natural site with clearly defined borders. It can be as large as a city, but in most cases it’s a single temple or a sacred grove. Gods don’t waste their powers on places that their worshipers can protect, so most divine guardians keep watch over abandoned burial grounds or lost temples. The divine guardian of such a site is charged with protecting it from harm and preventing incursions by those not of the faith. It must keep its vigil until the god deems the guardian’s task done.<br><br>If the divine guardian ever moves out of the area defined as the sacred site, it immediately loses the divine guardian template and any spellcasting ability the deity might have granted from class levels. It cannot regain the template unless it atones for its failure (usually by completing some quest or via an&nbsp;atonement&nbsp;spell) and reenters the site within 1 week. Otherwise, it loses the template permanently, taking 6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years of lost food, drink, and sleep return to it tenfold. A creature that lacks a Constitution score takes 2d6 points of damage per Hit Die from this process. Even if it survives the Constitution drain, the creature can never regain the template.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Wis +4, Cha +4. If the base creature has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, it also gains Int +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A divine guardian gains a +5 racial bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Organization: </strong>Solitary.</p>"

Ambitious and cunning in their pursuit of land and glory, once dread lords attain their goals of conquest, they transition into tragic figures. They might find themselves hollow once their dreams are fulfilled, having nothing else to strive for, or could becoming heartless toward their charges, seeing them as ungrateful for all the lord sacrificed.<br><br>Some lords come into power through vile deeds and become targets of powerful curses wreaked by people they wronged or powerful divine entities that demand retribution. These despicable creatures are transformed into brooding immortals known as cursed lords. Regardless of how they rose to rule over their lands, their dark domains are dangerous and haunted places, as described beginning on page 159.<br><br>“Dread lord” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with Intelligence and Charisma scores of at least 6 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A dread lord uses the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here. If the creature is imprisoned within its domain as the result of a powerful curse, it instead becomes a cursed lord (see page 235).<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>Base creature’s CR + 1.<br><br><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A dread lord gains darkvision 120 feet. Defensive Abilities: A dread lord gains DR 5/good or silver. A dread lord gains fast healing 5 if it has fewer than 10 Hit Dice, or fast healing 10 if it has 10 or more Hit Dice.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A dread lord gains the following weakness.<br><br><em>Landlocked (Ex):</em> A dread lord’s power is drawn directly from its domain, which has a radius of 5 miles per Hit Die of the dread lord, centered on a fixed point of some significance to the dread lord. The dread lord loses all benefits of this template when not within its domain.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A dread lord gains several special attacks. For every 3 Hit Dice the dread lord has, it chooses a special attack from those listed below. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DCs for these abilities are equal to 10 + 1/2 the dread lord’s Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. The dread lord’s caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice (or the caster level of its existing spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).<br><br><em>All-Seeing (Sp):</em> Nothing happens in the dread lord’s realm without the dread lord becoming aware. It can use&nbsp;speak with animals, speak with plants, and&nbsp;stone tell&nbsp;as spell-like abilities each three times per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use&nbsp;clairaudience/clairvoyance&nbsp;as a spell-like ability three times per day, and the spell’s range extends to any place in its domain.<br><br><em>Dream Dominion (Su):</em> The dread lord has dominion over even the dreams of its subjects. It can use&nbsp;dream&nbsp;and&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;as spell-like abilities, each once per day, but targeting only creatures within its domain. If it has a CR of 9 or higher, then once per week it can attempt to gain control of a creature whose dreams it affects in this way. If the target fails a secondary Will saving throw, the dread lord enslaves it, as per&nbsp;dominate monster, in addition to the&nbsp;dream&nbsp;or&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;spell-like ability’s normal effects.<br><br><em>Fear Aura (Su): </em>The dread lord is terrifying to behold. Any creature within a 60-foot radius that sees or hears the dread lord must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for as long as it is within the aura, and for 1 minute thereafter. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same dread lord’s fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br><br><em>Magical Mastery (Su):</em> The dread lord draws magical power from its domain. It treats its caster level as 2 higher for the purposes of spells and spell-like abilities it casts, and the saving throw DCs of such spells and spell-like abilities increase by 1.<br><br><em>Master of the Four Winds (Sp):</em> The dread lord can control the weather within its domain. It can use&nbsp;fog cloud&nbsp;and&nbsp;gust of wind&nbsp;as spell-like abilities each three times per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use&nbsp;control weather&nbsp;as a spell-like ability once per day. If it has a CR of 8 or higher, it can use&nbsp;control winds&nbsp;as a spell-like ability once per day.<br><br><em>Physical Mastery (Su):</em> The dread lord draws strength and deftness from its domain. It gains a +4 profane bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.<br><br><em>Plant Affinity (Sp): </em>The dread lord’s control over its lands extends to the very plants. It can use&nbsp;entangle&nbsp;as a spell-like ability at will, and&nbsp;plant growth&nbsp;as a spell-like ability once per day. If it has a CR of 5 or higher, it can use&nbsp;tree stride&nbsp;as a spell-like ability at will. If it has a CR of 10 or higher, it can use&nbsp;liveoak&nbsp;as a spell-like ability once per day.<br><br><em>Unquestioned Ruler (Sp):</em> The dread lord’s subjects naturally bend to its will. It can use&nbsp;charm animal, charm person, and&nbsp;detect thoughts&nbsp;as spell-like abilities at will. If it has a CR of 10 or higher, it can use&nbsp;dominate animal, dominate person, and&nbsp;mass suggestion&nbsp;as spell-like abilities three times per day.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A dread lord gains the following special ability.<br><br><em>One with the Land (Su):</em> A dread lord can shape the hazardous landscapes formed as a consequence of its domain’s creation to its will. It can replace any normal or supernatural hazard present in its domain with another hazard, but the process takes 24 hours, during which time neither hazard functions. The combined CR of all hazards found within a lord’s domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can’t exceed twice its Hit Dice, and it cannot create any hazards whose CR exceeds its own. A dread lord’s affinity with the land grants it a +2 bonus on all Will saves.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Intelligence +4, Charisma +4.</p>"

Both of these special attacks have save DCs equal to 10 + 1/2 the dream eater’s Hit Dice + the dream eater’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Eating (Su): </em>As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dream eater can consume a creature’s subconscious dreams if the victim fails to resist with a Will save. A sleeping victim takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against this ability, but automatically wakens if the save is successful. On a failed save, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and the dream eater gains a number of psychic points equal to the Charisma drained, to a maximum amount of psychic points equal to the dream eater’s Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><em>Psychic Assault (Su): </em>As a swift action, a dream eater can imbue any melee attack he makes with a psychic assault, infusing the mind of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations. The magnitude of the effect depends on how many psychic points the dream eater spends in the assault. By expending 1 point, the dream eater can cause the victim to become dazzled for 1d6 rounds. By expending 3 points, he can make a victim become staggered for 1d6 rounds. By expending 5 points, he can make the victim nauseated for 1d6 rounds. By expending 7 points, he can make the victim confused for 1d6 rounds. And by expending 9 points, he can stun the victim for 1d6 rounds. The victim can resist the psychic assault entirely by making a Will saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>A dream eater gains telepathy with other dream eaters to a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +6, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A dream eater gains a +4 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth checks. He also gains a +8 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) and Knowledge (planes) checks, and these two skills are now always considered class skills for the creature.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Dreamspawn creatures are created when the lucid bodies of dreamers are killed in certain correupted areas of the Dimension of Dreams, their nightmarish final moments resulting in true death in the waking world. On some rare occasions, the creature or creatures responsible for the death of the dreamer are intrinsically bound to that dreamer’s death throes, their etheric forms dragged along with the victim’s fleeing soul and stranded somewhere between the sleeping and waking worlds. These creatures soon emerge on the Material Plane, bursting forth from their victim’s corpse as nightmarish spectres of the dream-thing they once were.<br><br>Dreamspawn creatures are always linked by ectoplasmic strands to the corpse of the dreamer that created them. They drain the corpse of fluids and essence in order to manifest, desiccating the remains in the process. Their initial manifestation usually disfigures the corpse in some horrifying manner. Dreamspawn creatures are forced to drag the remains of dead dreamers behind them, motivate to experience the Material Plane but shackled to their creator’s rotting body.<br><br>These otherworldly creatures seek out new host bodies to replace the original rotting corpses that first brought them into the world. This effort allows them to extend their lives as their host body rots beyond repair. Those who hunt these escaped nightmares and seek to silence them have learned to sense the eerie vibrations that accompany the dreamspawn’s violation of planar physics, and use it to their advantage to locate and destroy the creatures.<br><br>“Dreamspawn creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Dreamspawn creatures are typically at least one size category larger than their hosts. A dreamspawn creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as the base creature’s CR + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Usually evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to outsider (extraplanar). Do not recalculate base class Hit Dice, BAB, saves, or skill points.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A dreamspawn creature gains thoughtsense 60 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Thoughtsense (Su): </em>A dreamspawn creature can automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within the specified range (usually 60 feet). This functions similarly to the blindsight ability. Nondetection, mind blank, and similar effects can block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and non-sentient (Intelligence 1–2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura: </strong>A dreamspawn creature has the following aura.</p>\n<p><em>Discordant Feedback (Su): </em>The dreamspawn creature’s psychic energy creates an eerie, shrieking feedback in the minds of living creatures in a 10-foot radius. Creatures within the aura take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws while in the area, and must make a successful Will save or take 1d2 points of Charisma damage. Spellcasters who attempt to cast spells in the aura’s radius must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the dreamspawn creature’s Hit Dice + the dreamspawn creature’s Charisma modifier. If the character fails, the spell is expended but does not function. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A dreamspawn creature gains DR 5/good or silver, immunity to mind-affecting effects, and the following defensive ability.</p>\n<p><em>Span Planes (Su): </em>Dreamspawn creatures exist partially on the Material Plane and partially in the Dimension of Dreams. Dreamspawn creatures take half damage (50%) from all nonmagical attack forms, and full damage from magical weapons, spells, spell-like effects, supernatural effects, incorporeal creatures and effects, and force effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Same as the base creature. If the base creature does not have a fly speed, the dreamspawn creature gains a fly speed of 10 (perfect maneuverability) as a supernatural ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks: </strong>A dreamspawn creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. If the base creature has no other natural attacks, the dreamspawn creature gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the dreamspawn creature’s size.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A dreamspawn creature gains the following special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Sleepwalker (Su): </em>A dreamspawn creature is tethered to the corpse of the dreamer whose death birthed it, using it as a conduit between one world and the next. Typically, the desiccated corpse is dragged lifelessly along with the materialized dreamspawn creature, occupying an adjacent square and moving along with it. As a move action, the dreamspawn creature can also withdraw wholly into the corpse where it can control the movements of its host. While inhabiting the corpse, it can attack foes with a slam attack. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the dreamspawn creature as well, although its DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. The dreamspawn creature can materialize from the corpse as a free action. If a dreamspawn creature kills another corporeal target, it can discard its tethered corpse and attach itself to the newly killed victim.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Dex +4, Cha +2.</p>"

The mind and soul of an echohusk are erased from its being, leaving nothing but the psychic echo of the creature that scoured its mind.<br><br>Left unattended, echohusks do little other than attack creatures that disturb them. However, anyone who creates an echohusk possesses an innate mental link to the undead creature, and is able to command the echohusk to perform whatever gruesome tasks she desires.<br><br>Echohusks are common in and around Geb, where death from the powerful mental attacks of psychic spellcasters—even liches—is an all too common occurrence. In such areas, echohusks are found in groups, obeying the commands of their dark masters. In the deep reaches of the underworld, where lost travelers or wayward patrols might encounter psychic horrors like neothelids, masterless echohusks are more common; the ancient and terrible creatures that happen to spawn them typically have little use for mindless servants.<br><br>Many psychic creatures have attempted to perfect the technique of creating echohusks, but only the attacks of the incorporeal undead known as psychic stalkers (see page 45) can create echohusks without fail. The horrific nature of psychic stalkers is likely the reason for this phenomenon.<br><br>“Echohusk” is an acquired template that can be added to any living, intelligent corporeal creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>This depends on the creature’s new total number of Hit Dice, as given below.<br style=\"color: #ffffff;

It shapes itself into the form of an undead creature, creating a host for a soul unfortunate enough to be confined within it. The existence of an ectoplasmic being is a cruel one, and few souls willingly choose this painful form of undeath.<br><br>An ectoplasmic creature is approximately the same size as the body it inhabited in life, though it weighs nearly twice as much, as the ropes of undead matter that compose its body are signif icantly heavier than most living flesh.<br><br>Even more so than most undead beings, creatures born of ectoplasm live hateful existences, filled with nothing but a lust for destruction and suffering. They have no bodily needs and require no sustenance; the only thing an ectoplasmic creature feeds upon is its own hatred of the living.<br><br>Once a spirit has passed to the afterlife, it seldom wishes to return at all, let alone in a disfigured ectoplasmic body. Spirits that aren’t powerful enough to come back as ghosts or spectres sometimes return as ectoplasmic monsters, particularly when there are no remains of the creature’s original body for its soul to inhabit in the form of a skeleton or zombie. Sometimes, ghosts and other strong undead purposefully draw upon ectoplasm from the ethereal realm, yearning for even more power in their ectoplasmic hosts.<br><br>Those who suffer this sorrowful fate, by misfortune or choice, are usually stuck in their ectoplasmic prisons until death grants them sweet release from this unlife. The transition from death to ectoplasmic undeath is a torturous ordeal, as is retaining the horrid form into which the creature is reborn. Often, this persistent agony drives these beings beyond mad, creating within an insatiable rage akin to that experienced by frustrated ghosts and other haunted souls.<br><br>An ectoplasmic creature’s burning desperation and embitterment often pushes it toward violence: most such beings fling themselves into battle willingly, killing to satiate their natural hunger for the suffering of others, while simultaneously hoping to be killed and thus freed of their own suffering own.<br><br>Whenever in contact with surfaces (including walls they pass through), ectoplasmic creatures leave a trail of a silvery substance that resembles a slug’s mucus—a trait almost exclusive to these undead.

The horrors tend to prowl the areas in which they died, and rarely venture outside these areas, as though they were anchored there.<br><br>Though these entities rarely coordinate complicated actions with others of their kind, they seem to do so unintentionally at times. Their unnatural strength makes ectoplasmic creatures formidable combatants, which those not familiar with fighting ectoplasmic creatures would expect by looking at them.

An element-infused creature retains the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

In this way, not all water-infused creatures are necessarily identical. In order to select an ability, at least one of an elementinfused creature’s elements must match one of those listed in parentheses after the ability’s name.

This functions as gaseous form, but the creature instead has both a base speed and swim speed of 10 feet.<br><br><em>Quickness (fire): </em>The creature’s base movement speed increases by 10, and it gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. For every 5 HD the creature has, its base speed increases by an additional 10 feet (maximum = double its base speed), and its initiative bonus increases by 1 (maximum +5).<br><br><em>Swim (water): </em>The creature gains a swim speed equal to its highest speed (maximum 100 feet). The creature also gains the amphibious and aquatic subtypes.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>An element-infused creature can choose one or more of the following abilities.<br><br><em>Breath Weapon (Su, any):</em> The creature gains a breath weapon (15-foot cone or 30-foot line) that it can use as a standard action once every minute. The breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of one of its associated energy types (Reflex half, DC = 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + Con modifier). The damage increases by 1d6 for every 3 HD the creature has. If the creature has 10 or more HD, the size of the breath weapon doubles.<br><br><em>Burn (Ex, fire): </em>The creature can set creatures it strikes on fire, as per the burn ability (Bestiary&nbsp;298), though only with attacks augmented by its energy attacks ability.<br><br><em>Energy Attacks (Ex, any):</em> One of the creature’s natural attacks deals an additional 1d6 points of its corresponding energy’s damage, selected when the creature gains this ability. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 10 HD the creature has. An element-infused creature can select this ability multiple times, applying its benefits to an additional two natural attacks each time.<br><br><em>Gusting Strike (Ex, air):</em> Once per round when the creature hits with a melee attack, it can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against the target of its melee attack as a free action. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br><br><em>Toppling Strike (Ex, earth or water): </em>The element-infused creature gains the trip special ability (Bestiary: 305) with one of its natural attacks.<br><br><strong>Abilities: </strong>An element-infused creature gains a +4 bonus to two ability scores of its choice, a +2 bonus to two other ability scores of its choice, and a –2 penalty to one ability score of its choice. (Go to the \"Changes\" tab to set these modifiers)<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An element-infused creature with racial Hit Dice has a number of skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + Intelligence mod. Racial class skills are unchanged, and class level skill ranks are unaffected.<br><br><strong>Languages:</strong> The creature gains an elemental language or languages associated with its elemental type as long as it has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher: Aquan (water), Auran (air), Ignan (fire), or Terran (earth). If the base creature is unable to speak, it can instead understand the acquired languages.</p>"

It’s not always apparent which prophets succeed, and mere weeks after death, the mindscapes of those prophets who failed begin to collapse.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Both<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Fey creatures resemble the mundane creatures they derive from, but with brighter colors, delicate features, and elegant wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their fragile-seeming appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as their non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for grace and the ability to fly. They live long lives, barring death by misadventure, and rarely show outward signs of age.<br><br>Some fey creatures owe their nature to fey ancestors interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures and were infused with fey essence through the magic of learned spellcasters or the influence of ancient powers of nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely dwell in civilized lands, both by preference and because the conditions that give rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched by great fey powers, fey creatures soon seek them out.<br><br>Though more prone to mischief than mayhem, fey creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim view of interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foul-tempered intruders risk humiliation at best if they insult the fey, and much worse if they raise arms against them. More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed though sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn powers to lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into mere inconvenience.<br><br>Fey creatures generally have cordial relationships with animals, allies of nature such as druids, and other fey. Exceptions exist where rival communities of fey dwell in proximity to one another. In these cases, any fey creatures in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according to their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such conflicts. Fey creatures derived from horses and the like often serve as mounts, though only to other fey or to allies of nature who acknowledge them as at least near-equals, if not full partners.<br><br>“Fey Creature” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature.

Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A fey creature gains low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Reduce the creature’s natural armor, if any, by 1 (minimum of 0).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A fey creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, resist cold and electricity 10, and DR 5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or DR 10/cold iron (if 12 HD or more).</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Unless the base creature flies better, the fey creature flies at 1-1/2 times the base creature’s land speed (good maneuverability), rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 feet. If the creature already has flight with a maneuverability of good, it increases to perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>A fey creature gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof.</p>\n<p><em>Camouflage (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature can use Stealth to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature.</p>\n<p><em>Change Shape (Su)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature can change shape into a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size category, or an animal within one size category. In all cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type of&nbsp;polymorph&nbsp;spell used should be chosen as appropriate based on the alternate form, such as&nbsp;alter self&nbsp;for taking humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than once, granting an additional form each time.</p>\n<p><em>Energy Resistance (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature gains resistance 10 to one energy type, or increases an existing resistance by 10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity instead. This ability can be selected more than once.</p>\n<p><em>Evasion (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue ability of the same name.</p>\n<p><em>Long Step (Su)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once every 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Spell Resistance (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 + its CR. This does not stack with any existing SR possessed by the base creature.</p>\n<p><em>Trackless Step (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires.</p>\n<p><em>Vanish (Su)&nbsp;</em>As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for 1 round as if affected by&nbsp;invisibility. It can use this ability for 1 round per day per Hit Die.</p>\n<p><em>Woodland Stride (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A fey creature can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect it. Optionally, this ability may function in a different type of terrain, to allow the fey creature to move through, swamps, rocky areas, ice, and so forth. Whatever the choice, this ability only functions in one type of terrain.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Inherited<br><strong>Simple Template&nbsp;</strong>No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Although most golems are animated by the spirits of elementals, certain reckless or daring golem crafters instead bind evil outsiders such as daemons, demons, and devils to power golems. This fiend does not inhabit or control the golem in the usual manner of fiendish possession; instead, the outsider is subjugated within the golem to act as a mere engine. Although a fiend-infused golem has more self-awareness and cunning than a typical golem, it possesses only a brute, primitive intellect, lacking the animating fiend’s personality beyond a base desire to destroy goodness. The fiend’s rage at being imprisoned in such a manner manifests as ever-burning hellfire, which the fiend-infused golem uses as a weapon against its foes.<br><br>As with ordinary golems, fiend-infused golems primarily serve as guards or defenders. However, a fiend-infused golem’s marginally improved intellect means it can be given more complex instructions, such as evaluating an intruder’s intent, activating or deactivating traps, acting in disguise, or patrolling a convoluted territory. Although fiend-infused golems are obligated to follow their creators’ commands in the same manner as regular golems, they sometimes do so with sullenness or frustrated defiance.<br><br>The foremost golem crafters of antiquity served the Jistka Imperium many thousands of years ago, and that empire’s golem foundries at Rachikan experimented extensively with fiend-bound golems. Using evil outsiders as an animating force came with an inherent drawback that Rachikan’s golem crafters could never fully overcome: the fiend’s seething anger at serving within a golem increases the chance that the fiend-infused golem will break free of its command and run amok. Ultimately, the golem crafters of Rachikan succeeded only by increasing the size of their golems: Rachikan’s enormous behemoth golems (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms&nbsp;40) are the only fiendinfused golems that do not risk the bound fiend going berserk. Although the Jistka Imperium is long gone, fiend-infused golems still guard its ancient factories and treasure vaults, particularly in the ruins of Rachikan and in other hidden sites along the Chelish coast.<br><br>With renewed interest in the Jistka Imperium among such organizations as the Pathfinder Society and Egorian’s prestigious Athenaeum, ancient secrets of fiend-infused golems have leaked to several modern golem crafters. Some of these crafters had already developed their own techniques for creating fiend-infused golems, and use the unearthed Jistkan lore to confirm or supplement their own designs. The artificers of House Thrune are particularly interested in harnessing and improving upon the Jistkan methods, both because the golems promise to be very powerful additions to the Thrune arsenal and because they are always looking for new ways to bind the spirits of Hell.<br><br>A fiend-infused golem is the same size and weight as an ordinary golem of its type.<br><br>“Fiend-infused” is a template that can be added to any golem that is not vulnerable to fire (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The fiend-infused template must be applied when the golem is created; an existing golem can’t later acquire this template. A fiend-infused golem uses all of the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Always neutral evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>Fiend-infused golems gain fast healing 5 and immunity to fire. If the base creature already has damage reduction, it adds good to the qualities needed to bypass that reduction. If the base creature has the immunity to magic defensive ability, it adds susceptibility to&nbsp;banishment&nbsp;and&nbsp;dismissal&nbsp;(see the immunity to magic ability above).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A fiend-infused golem gains the berserk liberation special attack described above and loses any berserk special attack of the base creature. The amount of damage dealt when the fiend-infused golem goes berserk is equal to 1d6 × its CR (Reflex half; DC = 10 + 1/2 the golem’s Hit Dice + the golem’s Constitution modifier). A fiend-infused golem also gains the hellfire touch special attack described above.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>A fiend-infused golem’s Intelligence score changes to 4 and its Charisma score changes to 10.<br>Feats: A fiend-infused golem has feats appropriate for its Hit Dice. The golem’s creator determines the golem’s feats as part of the process of creating the construct. Fiend-infused golems can be assigned any feats they are physically capable of using, although most feats are assigned from the following: Blind-Fight, Combat Reflexes, Intimidating Prowess, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Intimidate), Toughness, and Weapon Focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A fiend-infused golem gains ranks in Intimidate equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>A fiend-infused golem understands Abyssal and Infernal, but it cannot speak.</p>\n<p><strong>Construction: </strong>A fiend-infused golem’s base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base creature’s cost to account for the materials that are needed to bind the fiend within the golem. Add the spells&nbsp;dimensional anchor,&nbsp;magic circle against evil, and either&nbsp;planar ally&nbsp;or&nbsp;planar binding&nbsp;to the base creature’s requirements.<br><br>The DC of the Craft check required to make the fiend-infused golem’s body is 4 higher than the base creature’s construct skill DC, and the creator must have a minimum caster level 4 higher than the base creature’s minimum required caster level. The increase to the DC of the Craft check and to the caster level are halved (to 2 higher) if the creator possesses at least 10 ranks in Knowledge (planes).</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Collectively known as “the after-storm” by Belkzen natives, floodslain are victims of flash floods that have risen as undead. They’re creatures of panic and despair, driven by anger, fear, and a yearning to drag others into the waters. Long after the floodwaters recede, floodslain continue spreading the miserable death that claimed them.<br><br>Floodslain are similar in appearance to their original living forms, and are recognizable even in their waterlogged state. Many were gruesomely damaged by the floods that took their lives, though, their bodies battered and broken by rushing water and debris. The one feature common among all floodslain is wild, panicked eyes—a telltale sign of a death mired in shock and fear. Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a contained threat in some areas, the relatively flat floodplains of Belkzen offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee. Targets who escape often draw the attention of yet more floodslain, eventually leading the undead to their homes. In great numbers, floodslain can slaughter small settlements.<br><br>While many find the possibility of undead born from purely natural disasters to be disturbing in and of itself, theories from druids and scholars in Lastwall hold even more chilling implications. Given that floodslain are most common in eastern Belkzen yet are little known outside that region, it is suspected that the floodwater itself was cursed even before falling as snow, perhaps by the dark influence of Gallowspire. If the Whispering Tyrant’s insidious reach could extend so far using only passing clouds, the crusaders of Lastwall might be facing a threat even more dire than they realize.<br><br>“Floodslain” is an acquired template that can be added to any non-aquatic living creature. A floodslain uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR: </strong>Same as base creature + 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Chaotic evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class BAB or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor increases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, floodslain creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A floodslain creature gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/magic, and cold resistance 10 in addition to other defensive abilities granted by the undead type.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>A floodslain creature gains a swim speed of 30 feet unless it already possesses a swim speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A floodslain creature gains a slam attack based on its size, if the base creature doesn’t have one. Its slam attack also delivers the drowning touch effect (see below). Its natural attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>Floodslain creatures gain several special attacks. The save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the base creature’s HD + its Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Crashing Waters (Su): </em>Once per day, a floodslain creature can instinctively summon a spectral echo of the rushing waters that created it. This mass of phantom water slams the floodslain creature from behind, carrying it forward at up to three times its normal speed and enabling it to charge a single target. These waters also impact all creatures near the end of the floodslain creature’s movement, pushing them back. This acts as a bull rush; the floodslain creature attempts a single combat maneuver check against the CMD of each creature within 10 feet of the end of its charge. This bull rush attempt doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p><em>Create Spawn (Su): </em>Any creature killed by a floodslain creature rises as a floodslain creature if it’s left immersed in water for 24 hours. These spawn aren’t under the control of their creators.<br>Drowning Touch (Su): The slam attack of a floodslain creature partially fills a living victim’s lungs with water.

A ghost retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype.<br><br><strong>Armor Class: </strong>A ghost gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier. It loses the base creature's natural armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses not from force effects or&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;items.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. Ghosts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Ghosts gain channel resistance +4, darkvision 60 ft., the incorporeal ability, and all of the immunities granted by its undead traits. Ghosts also gain the rejuvenation ability.<br><br><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em> In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the “destroyed” spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different ghost by the GM.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect), unless the base creature has a higher fly speed.<br><br><strong>Melee and Ranged Attacks: </strong>A ghost loses all of the base creature's attacks. If it could wield weapons in life, it can wield&nbsp;ghost touch weapons&nbsp;as a ghost.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, but any relying on physical contact do not function. In addition, a ghost gains one ghost special attack from the list below for every 3 points of CR (minimum 1—the first ability chosen must always be corrupting touch). The save DC against a ghost's special attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost's HD + ghost's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Additional ghost abilities beyond these can be designed at the GM's discretion.<br><br><em>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</em> The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).<br><br><em>Corrupting Touch (Su):</em> All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inflicts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not negative energy—it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.<br><br><em>Draining Touch (Su):</em> The ghost died while insane or diseased. It gains a touch attack that drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects on a hit. On each such successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself. When a ghost makes a draining touch attack, it cannot use its standard ghostly touch attack.<br><br><em>Frightful Moan (Su):</em> The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.<br><br><em>Malevolence (Su): </em>The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a&nbsp;magic jar&nbsp;spell (caster level 10th or the ghost's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours.<br><br><em>Telekinesis (Su):</em> The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher).<br><br><strong>Abilities:</strong> Cha +4; as an incorporeal undead creature, a ghost has no Strength or Constitution score.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth skill checks. A ghost always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills.

Alone, each individual is a barely sentient construct so tiny as to be practically invisible, a speck of dust that moves under its own power. Brought together by the thousands into a swarm, however, the complex linking of simple systems creates an emergent consciousness of humanlike intelligence, although alien enough to make communication nearly impossible. Granule construct swarms exist solely to infest larger living organisms and reproduce in the relative safety and comfort provided by their bodies. Capable of repairing and replicating out of the raw elements around them, granule constructs within a host are almost unstoppable through physical means, burrowing their way into flesh and sending signals through the bloodstream. Once safely ensconced, granule construct swarms modify their hosts to maximize survival potential, a trait that leads certain people to intentionally cultivate granule construct swarms inside themselves, despite the resulting deformities. Energy damage to a host damages the granule construct swarm equally, but normal weapon damage does not. Granule constructs can vacate dead or dying creatures whenever they so choose, emerging as a standard swarm.<br><br><strong>Environment:&nbsp;</strong>Although created in arcane laboratories, granule construct swawrms can travel anywhere safe to their host creatures.<br><br><strong>Typical Physical Characteristics:&nbsp;</strong>Up close, each microscopic granule construct appears as a silver sphere with an all-purpose orifice at one end that it uses to gather information, take in nutrients, and focus the electromagnetic charges that propel it through the air. At the opposite end emerges a single manipulator claw. In a swarm, they appear as a dense cloud, somewhere between dust and a shadow, that constantly shifts shape and emits a faint hum. Once inside a host's body, a granule construct swarm makes a number of modifications which it finds beneficial, toughening it and making it more aware to ensure maximum survival.<br><br>\"Granule construct host\" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or vermin (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template&nbsp;</strong>Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Undying tyrants and eternal champions of the undead, graveknights arise from the corpses of the most nefarious warlords and disgraced heroes—villains too merciless to submit to the shackles of death. They bear the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight’s essence is fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of its battle lust. This armor becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone locked within.<br><br>“Graveknight” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most graveknights were once humanoids. A graveknight uses the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR: </strong>Same as base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The graveknight’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura: </strong>A graveknight emanates the following aura.</p>\n<p><em>Sacrilegious Aura (Su): </em>A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the spell&nbsp;desecrate&nbsp;and uses the graveknight’s armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits of this effect (including the bonus hit points, as this aura is part of the graveknight’s creation). In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area—such as through a cleric’s channel energy ability, a paladin’s lay on hands, or any spell with the healing subtype—must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight’s Hit Dice + the graveknight’s Charisma modifier. If the character fails, the effect is expended but does not function.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a graveknight uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A graveknight gains channel resistance +4; DR 10/magic; and immunity to cold, electricity, and any additional energy type noted by its ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also gains spell resistance equal to its augmented CR + 11.<br>The graveknight also gains the following ability.<br><br><em>Rejuvenation (Su): </em>One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the undead horror’s body. This process takes 1d10 days—if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the process anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully healed.<br><br><strong>Attacks: </strong>A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base creature didn’t have one. Damage for the slam depends on the graveknight’s size (see&nbsp;Bestiary&nbsp;302).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A graveknight gains the following special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight’s HD + the graveknight’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Channel Destruction (Su): </em>Any weapon a graveknight wields seethes with energy, and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice the graveknight has. This additional damage is of the energy type determined by the ruinous revivification special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Devastating Blast (Su): </em>Three times per day, the graveknight may unleash a 30-foot cone of energy as a standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight has (Reflex for half). This damage is of the energy type determined by the graveknight’s ruinous revivification special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Undead Mastery (Su): </em>As a standard action, a graveknight can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the graveknight’s control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day to break free from the graveknight’s control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same graveknight’s undead mastery for 24 hours.<br><br>A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the graveknight exceeds this number, the excess from earlier uses of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per&nbsp;animate dead.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A graveknight gains the following.<br><br><em>Phantom Mount (Su): </em>Once per hour, a graveknight can summon a skeletal horse similar to a&nbsp;phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical&nbsp;phantom steed, and can carry one additional rider. The mount’s powers are based on the graveknight’s total Hit Dice rather than caster level. A graveknight’s mount looks distinctive and always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later.</p>\n<p><em>Ruinous Revivification (Su): </em>At the time of its creation, the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight’s life or death, defaulting to fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type influences the effects of several of a graveknight’s special abilities.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a graveknight has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Ride checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>Graveknights gain Improved Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>No<br><br>Haunted ones are mortals who share their bodies with strange intelligences of supernatural origin. While technically undead, these disembodied intellects exist only as thought—they cannot directly interact with the world until they find a host willing to share both body and mind.<br><br>In essence, a haunted one is two creatures—a living host (almost always a humanoid with at least a modicum of intelligence) and its rider (the unbodied entity). The term “haunted one” specifically refers to the host as influenced by its rider.<br><br>While all riders possess their own intelligence and have unique goals and motivations, they are similar enough to present them as related entities. Riders attempt to influence their hosts by disseminating cryptic ideas and motivations among the host’s own thoughts and memories. A rider’s methods of influencing its host are subtle yet effective, though ultimately it has no ability to override the host creature. It cannot take control of the host’s body, and throughout the “possession” the host retains its free will. Instead, the rider can strong-arm its host, much like when casting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=geas/quest\">geas/quest</a>—a host who fails to act upon the rider’s “requests” suffers increasingly adverse physical and mental ailments. These effects can, at their most potent, cause the host permanent damage or even death. Typically, the rider departs after its host perishes, though it is unclear whether the adverse effects are produced to attempt to further sway the host, or as a result of the rider choosing to depart because the host continually disregards its suggestions.<br><br>Still, being a haunted one is not without some benefits. Haunted ones possess the uncanny ability to recall fantastic amounts of knowledge in areas of study previously unknown to them, often including information beyond the scope of the greatest scholars. Typically, this knowledge concerns something ancient and occult, forbidden things that most would find horrifying and maddening, which the host feels compelled to seek out and explore. Similarly, riders inherently sense the presence of others like themselves, and often use the host to track their rivals down. While these urges are not inherently beneficial, hosts who appease them begin to develop stronger connections with their riders. As a result, the rider becomes more efficient at transferring greater amounts of lost knowledge to the host.<br><br>The circumstances by which a creature can be exposed to an unbodied entity capable of transforming it into a haunted one are numerous, but if the targeted creature wishes to resist the attempt by the rider to invade its mind, the host-to-be can attempt a DC 15 Will save. If the save is successful, the unbodied entity fails to possess the host, and may not try again for 24 hours.<br><br>“Haunted one” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature of average intellect or better (Intelligence 10 or higher). Typically, the base creature is a humanoid—although other creatures are not unheard of.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> As base creature +1.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> All riders have an alignment—most are chaotic, evil, or both. When a host becomes a haunted one, its alignment changes to match the rider’s. Typically, when a host attempts an act out of keeping with this alignment, the rider punishes the host (see “Weaknesses” below).<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A haunted one gains the following weakness.<br><br><em>Haunted (Ex): </em>If at any point a haunted one’s rider spirit feels the haunted one needs “persuasion” to follow its demands, the spirit can inflict 1d6 points of Constitution damage upon the haunted one as a free action, up to once per round. The haunted one can resist this Constitution damage by making a DC 20 Fortitude save—with a successful save, the spirit cannot attempt to harm the haunted one in this manner again for 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>A haunted one gains the following four special abilities.<br><br><em>True Lore (Su):</em> Once per day, a haunted one can gain a +20 insight bonus on any Knowledge skill check that it makes, provided that the haunted one possesses at least one skill rank in that Knowledge skill. Every 5 HD possessed by the haunted one grants an additional daily use of this ability.<br><br><em>Vision (Sp):</em> Once a day, a haunted one can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=vision\">vision</a>&nbsp;as a spell-like ability (Caster Level equals the haunted one’s HD).

If the base creature has immunity to magic, it gains the following change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Dispel%20evil\">Dispel evil</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=dispel%20law\">dispel law</a>&nbsp;drives the hell engine back 30 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A hell engine gains the following weakness.<br><br><em>Contract Powered (Ex):</em> A hell engine draws power from the infernal contract that animates it. A hell engine cannot attack the devil that drafted its contract, the mortal who signed it, or any creature holding an original copy of the contract. Spells cast by the devil that wrote the contract or its mortal signatory automatically bypass any spell resistance or immunity to magic the hell engine has. If both copies of the contract are destroyed, the hell engine ceases to function until a new one is created.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A hell engine gains the following.<br><br><em>Breath Weapon (Su)</em>: As a standard action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a hell engine can exhale a churning cloud of hellfire in an adjacent space equal to its own size. This hellfire persists for 1 round; each creature within the area when the hell engine creates it (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud until the start of the hell engine’s next turn) takes 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage per 2 Hit Dice of the base creature. A creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + half the base creature’s HD) for half damage. The hellfire cloud also provides concealment as if from a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=fog%20cloud\">fog cloud</a>&nbsp;spell.<br><br>The hell engine can use this breath weapon in addition to any breath weapon the base creature has, and it can use up to two breath weapons simultaneously as a full-round action. Simultaneous breath weapons both fill the area of either the hellfire breath weapon or base creature’s breath weapon (hell engine’s choice). If the base creature’s breath weapon deals fire damage, a simultaneous breath weapon converts half of that damage into unholy damage.<br><br><em>Banishing Strike (Su):</em> Three times per day as an immediate action, the hell engine can force an extraplanar or summoned creature it hits to attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half the base creature’s HD); on a failure, the target is forced back to its original plane as if by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=dismissal\">dismissal</a>&nbsp;spell.<br><br><em>Redirect Summons (Sp): </em>Within 1 minute of successfully using its banishing strike ability, a hell engine can redirect its planar energy to summon a devil as an immediate action with a 100% chance of success. The summoned devil remains for 1 hour. A hell engine can have only one summoned devil at a time. The hell engine’s Hit Dice determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table.<br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\"></p>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">HD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Devil</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Spell Level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Lemure\">Lemure</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bearded%20Devil%20(Barbazu)\">Bearded devil</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Erinyes\">Erinyes</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bone%20Devil%20(Osyluth)\">Bone devil</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">25</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Barbed%20Devil%20(Hamatula)\">Barbed devil</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">30+</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-top: 0px; color: inherit;\" href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ice%20Devil%20(Gelugon)\">Ice devil</a></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">9th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>A hivemind consists of a swarm of smaller creatures whose individual minds have supernaturally bonded into one to become a single, collective intelligence. Hiveminds often occur in swarms that have existed for generations and that have dwelled in areas of potent magical influence, particularly areas of strong psychic magic. Over time, the swarm learns to work together in more intelligent ways to achieve its goals, and it eventually evolves a cohesive mind. Of course, this evolution can be hastened by direct intervention of potent magic (typically something on the level of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=miracle\">miracle</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=wish\">wish</a>), or as an unintended side effect of esoteric rituals, the use or destruction of artifacts, or the deaths of powerful minds.<br><br>A hivemind swarm learns from its surroundings, which in turn shape its choices in the languages it learns and the psychic spells it develops a penchant for casting. An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience.<br><br>Eventually, the hivemind’s mental network takes on more complex tasks as a collective mind. At this point, the hivemind creates a nexus, a single individual in the swarm through which the collective routes all thought. While the nexus is often fairly inconspicuous within the teeming mass of the swarm, it is possible for a highly perceptive observer to notice its decisive movements, spellcasting gestures, or intense gaze. The death of the nexus does not eliminate the shared intelligence of a hivemind, but it is disruptive, forcing the collective to focus inward to regroup and form a new nexus.<br><br>“Hivemind swarm” is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/MonsterSubtypes.aspx?ItemName=Swarm\">swarm subtype</a>&nbsp;(referred to hereafter as the base creature). The hivemind template allows a swarm to increase in power and abilities, much like a class—when you create a hivemind swarm, you can customize its CR as needed by adjusting the number of additional Hit Dice (and thus associated statistics). A hivemind swarm uses the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> +1 for each additional Hit Die gained above the base creature’s Hit Dice.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> A hivemind swarm’s type remains unchanged unless the base creature was an animal or vermin. In this case, its type changes to magical beast.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A hivemind swarm gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Thoughtsense\">thoughtsense</a>&nbsp;to a range of 60 feet.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A hivemind swarm gains a +1 insight bonus to its AC per additional Hit Die.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> A hivemind swarm gains at least one racial Hit Die in addition to the Hit Dice of the base creature. The type of racial Hit Die the hivemind swarm gains is the same as that of the base creature. A hivemind swarm can never gain more than 20 racial Hit Dice in this manner.<br><br><strong>Saves:</strong> The hivemind swarm’s base saves increase as appropriate for a creature of its type as the hivemind swarm gains racial Hit Dice.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A hivemind creature retains all of the base creature’s defensive abilities and special qualities, including all swarm traits. Due to its increased Intelligence score, a hivemind swarm is not immune to mind-affecting effects; since a hivemind swarm has a single mind, mind-affecting effects treat it as a single target despite its numerous separate bodies.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A hivemind creature retains its swarm attack, and continues to deal automatic damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no attack roll needed. The swarm base damage is based on the hivemind’s Hit Dice, starting at 1d6 for 1 Hit Die and increasing by 1d6 for every additional 5 Hit Dice beyond the first.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A hivemind creature retains all of the base creature’s special abilities and gains the following special ability.<br><br><em>Psychic Spellcasting (Su):</em> A hivemind creature gains the ability to cast psychic spells as per a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Psychic\">psychic</a>&nbsp;of a caster level equal to the number of additional Hit Dice it gains when it gains this template. A hivemind swarm can still deal swarm damage to creatures whose space it occupies at the end of its move, even if it has already cast a psychic spell in that round.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> If a base creature’s Intelligence score is 10 or lower, the hivemind swarm gains a base Intelligence score of 11. A hivemind swarm’s Intelligence score increases by 1 point for every Hit Die it gains beyond the base creature’s Hit Dice. If the base creature’s Charisma is lower than 10, the hivemind swarm gains a base Charisma score of 10. For every 4 Hit Dice the hivemind swarm gains beyond the base creature’s Hit Dice, it gains a +1 bonus to an ability score of its choice (this bonus can be applied to Intelligence, and it stacks with the bonus to Intelligence that a hivemind swarm gains for every Hit Die it attains).<br><br><strong>BAB:</strong> A swarm’s base attack bonus increases as it gains racial Hit Dice as appropriate for a creature of its type.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> A hivemind swarm loses all feats that the base creature had but gains a number of feats as normal for a creature of its Hit Dice (as presented on Table 1–6 on page 293 of the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> A hivemind swarm loses all skill ranks that the base creature had but has skill ranks per racial Hit Die as defined by its creature type. A hivemind swarm’s class skills are the same as those that its creature type had and also include all Knowledge skills and Spellcraft.<br><br><strong>Languages:</strong> A hivemind creature gains telepathy (100 ft.) and can speak a number of languages of its choice equal to 1 + its Intelligence modifier.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A hivemind gains the following.<br><br><em>Hivemind Nexus (Ex):</em> The collective intelligence of the hivemind comprises a complex series of connections and pathways among the members of the swarm. In order to focus the mental power of the swarm, the collective network of minds selects an individual member known as a “nexus.” It is through the nexus that all actions and decisions are routed to the entire hivemind. A hivemind nexus often acts in a slightly different manner than the other members of the swarm, and an observer can single out a hivemind swarm’s nexus as a move action with a successful Perception check opposed by the hivemind’s Bluff or Stealth check (whichever skill has a higher modifier for the hivemind). The hivemind gains a racial modifier of +10 on this Bluff or Stealth check, due to the hundreds of similar-looking creatures constantly moving around it. Once a nexus is spotted, it can be slain if the observer manages to deal at least 1 point of damage to the swarm, provided that damage is applied in the same round that the observer managed to identify the nexus. If a nexus is destroyed, the hivemind swarm is staggered and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) in order to cast a spell. A hivemind swarm is able to create a new nexus by spending 1d6 rounds concentrating, during which time it can take no other action (including making any swarm attacks).</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>Yes<br><br>Scholars of the mind have many names for the part of the psyche that controls unconscious and animalistic urges— be it the primal brain, instinct, or simply the id. Some scholars believe that, were this underlying mind to seize control, a normally mild-mannered person would revert to a savage, bestial state; some even theorize that when a barbarian enters a rage, he is in fact tapping into the id to empower his wrath. But what would happen if powerful magic were to act upon the id and make it transform not only a person’s mind, but his physical being as well? One such method by which this can occur is via the curse of bestial dreams, an affliction that arises when the wishcraft of a vespergaunt interacts with powerful magical crystals infused with mortal dreams and memories—an affliction that, in time, transforms its victims into a deformed and bestial creature known as an id mutant.<br><br>An id mutant loses its identity almost entirely, changing into an animalistic version of its previous self. If its adjusted Intelligence score remains above 3, it can still speak and understand language, but it does not retain any societal affiliations it had prior to devolving. Survival becomes the paramount concern for an id mutant, and it focuses more on base animalistic desires—the thrill of the hunt, securing a safe lair, and procreation. An id mutant’s personality is entirely new—one based on fulfilling base needs, and as such an id mutant’s alignment changes to chaotic neutral.<br><br>When a humanoid becomes an id mutant, its physical deformations almost always result in a resemblance to a specific animal. Some believe this animal to be a sort of spirit animal, but in fact the animal associated with the mutation is somewhat arbitrary, influenced in part by the original creature’s temperament and personality.

Some id mutants gain an additional movement type as well (see Special Qualities, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>An id mutant gains a single natural attack. This can be a bite, a claw, a gore, a slam, or a talon. Damage caused by this natural attack depends on the id mutant’s size (see Table 3–1 on page 302 of the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary).</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>An id mutant gains one of the following as a bonus feat: Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, or Toughness.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Id mutants gain a +4 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +4, Con +4, Int –6 (minimum 1), Cha –4 (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>An id mutant gains one mutation from the list below for every 3 points of the base creature’s adjusted CR (minimum 1). Additional mutations beyond these can be designed at the GM’s discretion (although id mutants never gain supernatural or spell-like abilities in this manner, with the exception of the infectious mutation, described below).</p>\n<p><em>Additional Movement (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains a burrow, climb, or fly speed (average maneuverability) equal to the base creature’s unmodified speed. This mutation can be selected up to three times—each time, a different form of movement must be chosen.</p>\n<p><em>Additional Natural Attack (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains an additional natural attack chosen from the Melee entry above. This mutation can be selected multiple times.</p>\n<p><em>Aquatic (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains the aquatic subtype, a swim speed equal to its base land speed, and the amphibious special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Blindsense (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains blindsense to a range of 30 feet. This mutation may be selected multiple times— each time it is selected, the range increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Ferocious (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains ferocity.</p>\n<p><em>Infectious (Su): </em>Whenever an infectious id mutant damages a humanoid with one of its natural attacks, that humanoid must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the id mutant’s HD + the id mutant’s Constitution modifier) or be afflicted by the curse of bestial dreams (see page 4).</p>\n<p><em>Scent (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains the scent ability.</p>\n<p><em>Swift (Ex): </em>The id mutant’s base speed increases by an additional 20 feet.</p>\n<p><em>Tentacled (Ex): </em>The id mutant gains a number of tentacle attacks equal to its adjusted CR divided by 5 (minimum 2). Each tentacle also has the grab and constrict special attack (constrict damage equals the tentacle’s damage). This mutation can only be selected by id mutants of CR 10 or higher.</p>\n<p><em>Thick Hide (Ex): </em>The id mutant’s thick hide grants it DR 2/piercing. This mutation can be selected multiple times—each time it is selected, the DR increases by 2.</p>"

They not only revel in hunting down and killing their victims in gory, brutal fashion, but they draw supernatural strength and power from their victims’ fear and terror. They look similar to other creatures of their kind, but are often covered in gruesome scars and exude an aura of menace.<br><br>“Implacable stalker” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Most implacable stalkers are humanoids, monstrous humanoids, or outsiders. An implacable stalker uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.<br><br><strong>Senses: </strong>An implacable stalker gains the following.<br><br><em>Sense Fear (Su):</em> An implacable stalker is able to sense the fear of nearby living creatures. This functions similarly to blindsight, with a range of 120 feet, except it only allows the implacable stalker to detect creatures that are currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10). Additionally, this ability allows the implacable stalker to detect such creatures even through solid barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.<br><br><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor bonus increases by 6.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An implacable stalker gains DR 5/—, and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic 10. The implacable stalker also gains the following defensive ability.<br><br><em>Terrifying Inevitability (Su):</em> An implacable stalker is even more difficult to kill when in the presence of fear. As long as the implacable stalker is able to see or hear a creature currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10), it gains fast healing equal to its Hit Dice, its damage reduction increases to 10/—, and it gains spell resistance equal to 16 + its CR.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> An implacable stalker’s base land speed is reduced by 10 feet if its base speed is 20 feet or higher.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An implacable stalker gains the following special attacks.<br><br><em>Fear Aura (Su): </em>Creatures that have at least 5 fewer Hit Dice than the implacable stalker must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 1 minute if they come within 60 feet of it. Even if they succeed at their saves, they gain the shaken condition for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the implacable stalker, and for 1 round thereafter. All other creatures within this radius must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain within 60 feet of the implacable stalker, and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same implacable stalker’s aura until the creature has left the aura and reentered it. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.<br><br><em>Gory Display (Ex):</em> Whenever an implacable stalker kills a sentient living creature, as a swift action, it can revel in the kill, shredding its victim’s corpse in a gruesome display of power. If it does, it chooses one of the following benefits: gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity for 1 minute, regain a single use of a spell-like ability that it can normally use three or more times per day, or immediately heal a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice.<br><br>Alternatively, instead of any of these benefits, the implacable stalker can cause a single creature within 60 feet to become more vulnerable to fear. Creatures affected in this way lose any immunity to fear they may have. If the creature did not possess immunity to fear, it takes a –4 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects, and all Intimidate checks attempted against it receive a +4 circumstance bonus. These effects last for 10 minutes. Finally, if the creature is currently immune to the implacable stalker’s fear aura because it succeeded at a previous saving throw, it loses that immunity.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An implacable stalker gains the following special qualities.<br><br><em>Nightmare Resurrection (Su):</em> When an implacable stalker dies, it creates a psychic imprint on the mind of each intelligent creature within 60 feet that witnessed its death. Each week, such creatures are subject to a&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the implacable stalker’s Hit Dice + the implacable stalker’s Charisma modifier; the normal modifiers for&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;based on knowledge and connection do not apply). In this&nbsp;nightmare, the creature is hunted and slain by the implacable stalker (for GMs using the nightmare dreamscape rules on page 162, these nightmares always have the “being chased” nightmare feature). A creature that succeeds at three consecutive saving throws to resist the effect is freed from it. If any creature fails at three consecutive saving throws to resist the&nbsp;nightmare, the implacable stalker returns to life, as per&nbsp;true resurrection. If its corpse has been completely destroyed, it returns to life in a random location within 5 miles of the creature that failed to resist the&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;effects. Once the implacable stalker is returned to life, the psychic imprint fades from all creatures still affected by it.&nbsp;Right Behind You (Sp): As a swift action, an implacable stalker can teleport to an unoccupied space, which must be adjacent to a creature the stalker is aware of that has the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition. The implacable stalker can travel a maximum distance of 480 feet with each use of this ability, and must wait 1d6 rounds between each use. Additionally, if the implacable stalker travels at least 40 feet, any shaken, frightened, or panicked creature it arrives adjacent to is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the implacable stalker’s attacks until the beginning of the implacable stalker’s next turn.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Strength +4, Constitution +6 (if the implacable stalker is an undead creature, it gains Charisma +6, instead).<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Implacable stalkers gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate checks, and a +6 racial bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to follow tracks.<br><br><strong>Feats: </strong>Implacable stalkers gain Diehard, Endurance, Intimidating Prowess, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template&nbsp;</strong>No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Jiang-shis (often known as “hopping vampires”) are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi’s appearance is based on the state of the creature’s corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands.<br><br>A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the body’s decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque form and seeks living creatures to feed upon.<br><br>“Jiang-shi” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most jiang-shis were once humans, but any creature that undergoes specific rites can acquire the template. A jiang-shi uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR: </strong>Same as the base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet. It also gains the ability to sense the breathing of living creatures—a jiang-shi has blindsight to a range of 60 feet against creatures that breathe. A creature may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, jiang-shis use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A jiang-shi gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and slashing, and resistance to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast healing 5. In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following defensive ability.<br><br><em>Prayer Scroll (Su): </em>The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to any effects generated from spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi‘s prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player’s Guide&nbsp;322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi’s immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi’s prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These things don’t harm a jiang-shi vampire—they merely keep it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round. Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn.<br><br>Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiang-shi vampire crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiang-shi vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire’s damage reduction. Additionally, any successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature. Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the day without harm.<br><br><strong>Speed: </strong>A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi’s base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature’s speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like fly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base creature didn’t have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the jiang-shi’s size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi’s claws are even more dangerous than this, though—see the “brutal claws” special attack below. A jiang-shi’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A jiang-shi gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi’s Hit Dice + the jiang-shi’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Brutal Claws (Ex): </em>A jiang-shi’s nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19–20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Drain Chi (Su): </em>Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains “chi,” or life energy, from a victim’s breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim’s breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As an undead creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score.<br>Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Acrobatics), and Spring Attack as bonus feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Perception, and Stealth checks.</p>"

The lich also gains the following defensive ability.<br><br><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em> When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days—if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the process anew.

		"Man-Eating Animal": {
			"name": "Man-Eating Animal",
			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Both<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Scholars will explain that though many animals fight to defend their territory and their young, only a few apex predators hunt humanoids for food. Yet any villager across the Inner Sea region can recount tales about maneating beasts that once lurked in the local wilderness (and might still). Any sort of animal can become a man-eater, from known predators to seemingly harmless herbivores. Though the creatures and locations may change, certain elements remain the same in tales of man-eating animals. Having tasted human flesh, these animals can’t be sated by any other type of food. Man-eaters have terrible bites, and hunters’ arrows bounce off their hides. Man-eaters are unusually bold, no longer frightened by human presence like their kin. Yet they are also canny, employing tactics no mere animal could conceive. Man-eaters appear able to understand human speech, and some of the more fanciful stories even claim the animals can speak.<br><br>A man-eating animal can be distinguished from its common relatives by its carnivorous teeth, enlarged jaws, and the glint of intelligence in its eyes.</p>\n<h1>Ecology</h1>\n<p>Most tales of man-eating animals are sparked by rabid or starving (but otherwise normal) animals, but true man-eaters do exist. Such abominations are the result of a fiendish spirit fusing with that of a mundane animal. Though not wholly fiendish in nature, the beast gains limited sentience, increased resilience, and unnatural appetites. Despite popular belief, eating humanoid flesh isn’t enough to turn an animal into a maneater. The creature must be exposed to chaotic and evil influences, whether from a planar gate, demonic altar, or transformative elixir (such as the&nbsp;blood of Baphomet). Man-eating animals can also result from botched summonings and incomplete exorcisms. A fiendish spark set loose might inhabit an animal’s form so that the foul spirit can continue to spread suffering.<br><br>Man-eating animals are no longer part of the natural ecology. They hunt almost ceaselessly, preferring intelligent prey above all else. They rarely die of natural causes, almost always meeting their ends in bloody conf lict. These creatures can and do mate with members of their original species. In cases of multiple births, only one of the litter inherits this corruption, and it soon devours its siblings.</p>\n<h1>Habitat &amp; Society</h1>\n<p>Individual man-eaters might be found anywhere—the freak results of black magic and vicious natures—but they’re encountered in numbers only where fiendish inf luence is strong. Man-eating animals are most common in the blasted landscape of the Worldwound, where they nearly outnumber their natural counterparts. In Kyonin, maneaters have been born to otherwise normal animals, a sign to the elves that Tanglebriar’s corruption is expanding.<br><br>Man-eating animals, especially large bovines such as aurochs and bison, are sacred to the followers of Baphomet, demon lord of beasts. Away from civilized lands, cults of Baphomet raise small herds of these carnivorous cattle, feeding them on corpses when live victims are unavailable. Man-eating animals serve as guards and pets for dark cultists and the demons they worship. Though too intelligent and willful to be trained like normal animals, man-eaters gladly serve those who encourage their bloodlust. A dissatisfied man-eater, however, is likely to turn on its so-called master the second its master displays a moment of weakness.<br><br>With their rudimentary intelligence, man-eating animals are able to understand the guttural tongue of the Abyss, and to learn common words in the language of those they hunt. Many take advantage of hunters who assume they are dumb animals.<br><br>Man-eaters’ combination of animal instinct and demonic cunning allows them to more easily hunt their preferred prey: humanoids. Man-eating animals are known to track victims over long distances, their enhanced senses and great endurance allowing them to continue the chase long after their prey becomes fatigued. An innate sense of direction sometimes allows a man-eater to anticipate (or overhear) its victim’s destination and reach it before the creature. Even latched gates and animal traps prove ineffective against the man-eater’s cunning.<br><br>“Man-Eating” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a creature of the animal type. A maneating animal uses all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR: </strong>HD 4 or fewer, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>A man-eating animal’s type changes to magical beast. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>A man-eating animal’s natural armor improves by +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>A man-eating animal’s racial HD change to d10s.</p>\n<p><strong>Defenses/Qualities: </strong>A man-eating animal gains darkvision 60 feet, and DR 5/slashing (if HD 11 or fewer) or 10/slashing (if HD 12 or more).</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A man-eating animal gains a bite attack. Damage from the bite attack depends on the creature’s size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;301–302). If the base creature already has a bite attack, it gains Improved Natural Attack (bite) and Improved Critical (bite) as bonus feats. It also adds 1-1/2 times its Str bonus to the damage (or twice its Str bonus if a bite is its only natural attack).</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4.</p>\n<p><strong>BAB: </strong>A man-eating animal’s base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A man-eating animal gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>A man-eating animal understands Abyssal and Common, but cannot speak.</p>"

The dangerous radiations of magic gone afoul infuse the bodies and essences of these wanderers. Those who spend too much time in the Spellscar Desert or the wasteland’s other treacherous environs occasionally fall prey to the deadly energies that persist in these regions, and their bodies gradually decay more and more until they are so far removed from their original forms that they can be described only as mutants. These twisted and degenerate creatures roam in packs throughout the Mana Wastes.<br><br>Because those who succumb to the Mana Wastes’ mutagenic effects often hail from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar or one of its smaller holdings in the region, numerous humanoid mutants are proficient in the use of firearms, having learned to wield the weapons in place of the unpredictable forces of magic. Those who manage to actually secure a powerful weapon from one of the dwarven arms factories in the Wastes often garner the respect of other mutants. Such firearm wielders invariably rise to positions of power, becoming known as wasteland lords by their envious peers, who all squabble and fight for the same honor.<br><br>Most Mana Wastes mutants collaborate in small tribal groups with other mutants, since those who wander the battered desert alone risk attack from the resident mutated vermin or violent bands of lawless gnolls, giants, or goblins. The civilized people of Alkenstar shun mutants for the most part, regarding transformed humans and other wanderers of the Mana Wastes as no better than monsters. The border guards of neighboring Nex keep a stringent lookout for such wasteland travelers and attack them on sight. The necromancers of Geb, however, see potential in the mutated peoples of the Spellscar Desert, and occasionally entreat them to leave their blasted home and relocate to the heart of Geb in Yled by promising a life of comfort and acceptance. In actuality, such mutants are taken to the infamous Mortuarium, where Geb’s cruelest wizards perform unholy experiments on Alkenstar’s deformed expatriates and turn them into undead abominations to serve in Geb’s lurching army.<br><br>“Mana Wastes Mutant” is an acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature.

If the base creature flew magically, it loses this ability.<br><br><strong>Melee:</strong> A Mana Wastes mutant retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the mutant’s size.<br><br><strong>Spell-Like Abilities:</strong> A Mana Wastes mutant loses access to any spell-like abilities the base creature may have had. Any spellcasting abilities gained from class levels remain unchanged.<br><br><strong>Special Abilities:</strong> A Mana Wastes mutant retains any extraordinary and supernatural special qualities of the base creature. A Mana Wastes mutant gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof (minimum 1— the first ability chosen must always be disease).<br><br><em>Acid Resistance (Su): </em>A Mana Wastes mutant gains resistance to acid 10.

A Mana Wastes mutant that gains acid resistance in excess of 30 becomes immune to acid instead.<br><br><em>Acidic Pustules (Ex):</em> Mana Wastes mutants are often covered in necrotic pustules that burst at the slightest touch. Whenever a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to a Mana Wastes mutant, all creatures adjacent to the Mana Wastes mutant must succeed at a Ref lex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Mana Wastes mutant’s Hit Dice + the Mana Wastes mutant’s Constitution modifier) or take acid damage as its boils and blisters pop and spray about. A Mana Wastes mutant deals an amount of acid damage in this way based on its size (1d4 points of acid damage for a Medium Mana Wastes mutant, 1d6 for a Large mutant, and so on).<br><br><em>Breath Weapon (Ex): </em>A Mana Wastes mutant can spray a 30-foot cone of acidic bile from its mouth as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds.

A mummified creature appears much as other mummies do—a dusty corpse, desiccated and withered, swathed in a funeral shroud of linen wrappings adorned with hieroglyphs—but a spark of malign intelligence gleams in its unliving eyes.<br><br>Mummified creatures differ from the standard mummy presented in the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;with regard to how and why they are created. Most standard mummies are created as simple tomb guardians; they gain abilities such as an aura of despair and mummy rot, but they usually lose their free will, much of their intelligence, and the abilities they possessed in life. A mummified creature, on the other hand, retains its intelligence, memories, and many of its other abilities. A mummified creature does not spread the curse of mummy rot, nor does the sight of it paralyze the living with fear, but its touch can reduce a living creature to dust and its very presence is frightening. Though slow and clumsy in undeath, a mummified creature is nonetheless capable of surprising bursts of speed and ferocity. Because of its creation process, however, a mummified creature is susceptible to energy damage, though determining an individual mummified creature’s vulnerability is not always easy.<br><br>Many mummified creatures are created to guard the tombs of important figures, but some powerful beings—rulers, high priests, mighty wizards, or even wealthy aristocrats—arrange to be transformed into mummified creatures upon their deaths. Unwilling to give up their lives and knowledge to the whims of fate, these people bind their souls to the dried husks of their dead bodies, trading oblivion for endless centuries of unlife. The truly wealthy sometimes arrange for their most favored spouses, concubines, servants, or guards to be mummified with them, enabling them to hold court in dusty tombs in an undead mockery of their old lives centuries after they perished.<br><br>To create a mummified creature, a corpse must be prepared through embalming, with its internal organs replaced with dried herbs and flowers and its dead skin preserved through the application of sacred oils. Unlike with standard mummies, a mummified creature’s brain is not removed from its skull after death. Injected with strange chemicals and tattooed with mystical hieroglyphs, a mummified creature’s brain retains the base creature’s mind and abilities, though the process does result in the loss of some mental faculties. Once this process is complete, the body is wrapped in special purified linens marked with hieroglyphs that grant the mummified creature its new abilities (as well as its weakness). Finally, the creator must cast a&nbsp;create greater undead&nbsp;spell to give the mummified creature its unlife.<br><br>“Mummified creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal creature (hereafter referred to as the base creature).

Creatures that fail this save are blinded for 2d4 rounds.<br><br><em>Undead Mastery (Su):</em> As a standard action, a mummy lord can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the mummy lord’s control (the save DC is Charisma-based).

A creature that succeeds at its Will save cannot be affected again by the same mummy lord’s undead mastery for 24 hours. A mummy lord can control 6 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the mummy lord exceeds this limit, any excess undead from earlier uses of this ability become uncontrolled, as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=animate%20dead\">animate dead</a>.

Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same nightmare creature’s fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear affect.<br><br><em>Frightful Presence (Su): </em>This ability activates when the nightmare creature charges, attacks during a surprise round, or succeeds at a DC 15 Intimidate or Perform check. Its frightful presence has a range of 30 feet.<br><br><em>Night Terrors (Su): </em>Once a nightmare creature enters a target’s mind with its&nbsp;dream&nbsp;or&nbsp;nightmare&nbsp;spell-like ability, it can attempt to control the target’s dream. If the target fails a Will saving throw, it remains asleep and trapped in the dream world with the nightmare creature. Thereafter, the nightmare creature controls all aspects of the dream. Each hour that passes, the target can attempt another saving throw to try to awaken (it automatically awakens after 8 hours or if the nightmare creature releases it). The target takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each hour it is trapped in the dream; if it takes any Charisma damage, it is fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The target dies if this Charisma damage equals or exceeds its actual Charisma score.<br><br><strong>Spell-Like Abilities: </strong>A nightmare creature gains the following spell-like abilities: Constant—protection from good; 3/day—detect thoughts,&nbsp;dream,&nbsp;nightmare,&nbsp;suggestion; 1/day—shadow walk.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Dex +4, Int +2, Cha +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A nightmare creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate and Stealth checks.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>No<br><br>Nosferatu are savage undead who may be the progenitors of the common, more refined vampires. The curse of the nosferatu lacks the elegance and romance of its modern form, harkening to a forgotten age of verminous hunger and eerie powers. Granted immortal life but not immortal youth, nosferatu are withered, embittered creatures unable to create others of their kind, as they somehow lost that ability long ago.<br><br>Their ancient sensibilities still ref lect the cruelty of epochs past, and their age-spanning plots are untethered by the modern aff liction of morality. Nosferatu resent common vampires (which they call “moroi,” an ancient term from a lost language) for their beauty, whereas those vampires scorn the nosferatu as bestial relics of an earlier age, best hidden away in remote ruins so as not to sully the charismatic reputation of “true” vampires.<br><br>Because nosferatu can’t create spawn, any nosferatu in existence are very old—created long ago in a time before they lost the ability to infect others with their undead curse. Most nosferatu live in isolated places with few visitors, and a nosferatu could be a thousand years old and yet have fewer than a dozen character levels because it lacks sufficient foes to challenge it or the initiative to train itself.<br><br>“Nosferatu” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most nosferatu were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A nosferatu uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A nosferatu gains darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, and scent.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a nosferatu uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A nosferatu gains channel resistance +4 and DR 5/wood and piercing (this includes all wood-shafted weapons such as arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins, even if the weapon’s actual head is made of another material). It also gains resistance 10 to cold, electricity, and sonic.<br><br>A nosferatu gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a nosferatu assumes its swarm form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin within 1 hour or be utterly destroyed. (In swarm form, it can normally travel up to 5 miles in 1 hour.) Additional damage dealt to a nosferatu forced into swarm form has no effect. Once at rest, the nosferatu is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>A nosferatu can’t tolerate the strong odor of garlic, and won’t enter an area laced with it. Similarly, it recoils from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don’t harm the nosferatu—they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and can’t touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.<br><br>A nosferatu cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so.<br><br>Reducing a nosferatu’s hit points to 0 incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay nosferatu. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its full normal hit points—a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu’s heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless its head is also severed and anointed with holy water.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the nosferatu is not harmed by running water.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A nosferatu gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn’t have any (1d4 points of damage for a Small nosferatu, 1d6 points of damage for a Medium one).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A nosferatu gains several special attacks. Its save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the nosferatu’s Hit Dice + the nosferatu’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Blood Drain (Ex): </em>A nosferatu can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or grappled living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom each round the pin is maintained. On each round it drains blood, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points).<br><br><em>Dominate (Su): </em>A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent’s will as a standard action. Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed at a Will save or fall instantly under the nosferatu’s inf luence, as though by a&nbsp;dominate person&nbsp;spell (caster level 12th). This ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM’s discretion, some nosferatu (such as a very old one or with an unusually strong bloodline) might be able to affect different creature types with this power.<br><br><em>Telekinesis (Su): </em>As a standard action, a nosferatu can use&nbsp;telekinesis&nbsp;(caster level 12th).<br><br><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A nosferatu gains the following.<br><br><em>Spider Climb (Ex): </em>A nosferatu can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a&nbsp;spider climb&nbsp;spell.<br><br><em>Swarm Form (Su): </em>As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The nosferatu gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it has transformed into. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu can’t use its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains the defensive abilities, weaknesses, and special qualities it gains from being a nosferatu, counts as an undead creature, and can use any of the swarm’s abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise.<br><br><em>Telepathy (Su): </em>A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet that speaks the same language it does. In addition, a nosferatu can use this ability to communicate with any animal, magical beast, or vermin.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +2, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +6, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a nosferatu has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A nosferatu gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>A nosferatu gains Alertness, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, and Skill Focus (in two different skills) as bonus feats.</p>"

A penanggalen uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as base creature +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change the base creature’s racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A penanggalen gains channel resistance +4, DR 5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A penanggalen also gains fast healing 5.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her human body and exposed to direct sunlight.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee: </strong>A penanggalen gains a bite attack and a slam attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen’s size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A penanggalen retains all of the base creature’s special attacks. She also gains the following additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the penanggalen’s HD + the penanggalen’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Blood Drain (Su): </em>A penanggalen’s blood drain special attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage.</p>\n<p><em>Create Spawn (Su): </em>When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and remains enslaved until that penanggalen’s destruction. A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.</p>\n<p><em>Disease (Su): </em>Any creature a penanggalen bites is exposed to filth fever—the save DC against this disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease itself.</p>\n<p><em>Wither (Su): </em>A penanggalen’s entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters and weakens living flesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen’s slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4 Charisma damage.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A penanggalen gains the following special quality.<br><br><em>Separate (Su): </em>During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At night, she can detach her head and entrails as a full-round action. Her physical but now hollow body exists as dead flesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen’s normal hit point total. Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in vinegar for 1 hour—she can then reattach to her body, at which point any damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her fly speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Petitioners are the souls of mortals brought to the Outer Planes after death in order to experience their ultimate punishment, reward, or fate. A petitioner retains fragments of its memories from life, and its appearance depends not only upon the shape it held in life but also upon the nature of the Outer Plane to which it has come. The stat block detailed above presents a typical petitioner formed from the soul of an average human—it does not include any of the plane-specific abilities or features a petitioner gains, and should be modified as appropriate depending on the plane to which the petitioner is assigned.<br><br>Creatures who die, become petitioners, and then return to life retain no memories of the time they spent as petitioners in the afterlife. A petitioner who dies is gone forever—its “life force” has either returned to the Positive Energy Plane or, in some cases, provided the energy to trigger the creation of another outsider. Petitioners who please a deity or another powerful outsider can be granted rewards—the most common such reward manifests as a transformation into a different outsider, such as an archon, azata, demon, or devil, depending upon the petitioner’s alignment. In rare cases, a creature can retain its personality from life all the way through its existence as a petitioner and into its third “life” as an outsider, although such events are rare indeed.<br><br>“Petitioner” is an acquired template that can be added to any creature whose soul migrates to one of the Outer Planes following its death (henceforth referred to as the base creature). The petitioner uses all of the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted below.<br><br><strong>CR: </strong>A petitioner’s CR is 1. In some cases, at the GM’s discretion, particularly large or unusual petitioners with higher than normal ability scores may begin with a higher CR; compare the petitioner’s statistics to the values on Table 1–1 on page 293 to help determine an unusual petitioner’s starting CR.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>A petitioner’s alignment is identical to that of its home plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Size and Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to outsider. It loses all subtypes. Its size does not change.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>Petitioners lose any unusual senses they had, but gain darkvision 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>The petitioner loses all racial bonuses to its Armor Class.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Petitioners lose all racial and class-based Hit Dice and gain 2d10 racial Hit Dice as outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>Saves: </strong>Petitioners have good Fortitude and Reflex saves; a petitioner’s base saves are Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +0.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>Petitioners lose all the defensive abilities of the base creature. Petitioners are immune to mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks: </strong>The creature’s BAB is +2, subject to modification for size and Strength. It loses all natural attacks and gains a slam attack as appropriate for a creature of its size.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>Petitioners lose all special attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Same as the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>Petitioners lose all feats. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner gains one feat—typically Toughness.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Petitioners lose all skill ranks they possessed as mortals. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner has 12 skill ranks it can spend on skills (with a maximum of 2 ranks in any one skill), and gains bonus skill ranks as appropriate for its Intelligence. Unlike most outsiders, petitioners do not gain an additional 4 class skills beyond those available to all outsiders.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>Petitioners lose all special qualities, along with all abilities granted by class levels (including increases on saving throws and to HD and BAB).</p>\n<h2>Petitioner Traits</h2>\n<p>A petitioner gains additional traits based on its home plane.<br><br><strong>Abaddon (Neutral Evil): </strong>The “hunted” have bodies that are identical to what they had in life—these petitioners are doomed to be stalked and eventually consumed by the daemons that lust for souls. A hunted that survives long enough eventually warps and twists into a daemon. The hunted gain DR 5/— and fast healing 1 so that they provide a slightly more robust hunt for their daemonic predators.</p>\n<p><strong>Abyss (Chaotic Evil): </strong>“Larvae” are perhaps the most hideous of petitioners—they appear as pallid, maggot-like creatures with heads similar to those they possessed in life. Larvae that feed long enough on Abyssal filth eventually transform into demons. They have cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10, and instead of a slam attack gain a bite attack as appropriate for their size.</p>\n<p><strong>Elysium (Chaotic Good): </strong>The “chosen” have idealized versions of their mortal bodies. In time, after experiencing the pleasures Elysium has to offer, the chosen become azatas. The chosen gain resistance to cold and fire 10 and a +2 bonus to Charisma.</p>\n<p><strong>Heaven (Lawful Good): </strong>The “elect” appear similar to their mortal forms, save that they possess a golden halo and feathered wings. After spending enough time aiding heavenly tasks, the elect become archons. They gain a fly speed equal to their base speed (average mobility).</p>\n<p><strong>Hell (Lawful Evil): </strong>The “damned” retain their mortal forms, but are heavily scarred by various tortures. Those who endure the torments of Hell long enough may eventually be approved for transformation into devils. The damned gain immunity to fire (but not immunity to the pain caused by fire—whenever one of the damned takes fire damage, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds).</p>\n<p><strong>Limbo (Chaotic Neutral): </strong>The “shapeless“ retain their basic forms, but these forms constantly waver and shimmer, as if they were ghosts in peril of dissolving away. After wallowing in the chaos of Limbo for long enough, they can transform into proteans. The shapeless have the incorporeal subtype, an incorporeal touch attack, and all advantages granted by that defensive ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Nirvana (Neutral Good): </strong>The “cleansed” take on the forms of animals that closely approximate their personalities. Upon achieving true enlightenment, they transform into agathions. The cleansed gain cold and sonic resistance 10 and a +2 bonus to Wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>Purgatory (Neutral): </strong>The “dead” appear as animated skeletons but are not undead—in time, they can earn the right to become aeons. They gain DR 10/bludgeoning and immunity to cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Utopia (Lawful Neutral): </strong>The “remade” retain the same body shape but have milky white skin covered in dense black script, as if some strange scribe had used them for parchment. Upon deciphering the riddles posed by these complex lines of script, one of the remade can enter an axiomite forge to be transformed into an inevitable. The remade are immune to hostile transmutation effects and gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence.</p>"

			"name": "Prana Ghost",
			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>The typical ghost is a nightmarish creature of dark emotion, with an undying thirst for justice or vengeance. These ghosts are often warped by deep emotional turmoil, madness, or contact with the dark radiations of the Negative Energy Plane—sometimes all three. But such twisted, tormented creatures are not the only spirits that cling to traces of their former lives on the Material Plane. There is another kind of ghost, just as dedicated, but more rational and often more subtle.<br><br>As a soul departs a body, it joins the great River of Souls winding its way through the Astral Plane and passes on to judgment in the Outer Planes. Sometimes such a soul, through force of will or an unquenchable desire to accomplish one last act, forces its way back to the Material Plane as a prana ghost. Formed entirely of vital life essence, or prana, this manifest spirit is not an undead creature, but rather something entirely different, though undead that gorge on life energy are drawn to the glut of prana that composes a prana ghost like scavengers to a fresh corpse. Though easily mistaken for the undead spirits they resemble, prana ghosts function very differently from normal ghosts, haunts, and other incorporeal undead.<br><br>Unlike the raging etheric ghost, a prana ghost tends to avoid worldly affairs when it can. It acts as mentor and guide to the living rather than acting overtly. These ghosts exude a supernatural calm and exhibit great control over their emotions and desires, wishing only to accomplish the task at hand, and to do so as quickly and as safely as possible. Even so, when victory (or failure) looms, a reckless prana ghost may attempt to take matters into its own hands. Such an intervention can be a great surprise to those who had no idea a supernatural entity was pulling the strings of their agents and allies. Among virtuous creatures who were unaware of the aid they were receiving, the prana ghost’s appearance might lead to violence if the prana ghost can’t convince them it isn’t undead.<br><br>Once a prana ghost succeeds at its task, or its failure becomes clear, it dissipates from the world and reenters the Astral Plane. Many prana ghosts then resume their passage toward the Outer Planes, but a few dwell on the Astral Plane for centuries, if not millennia. Such prana ghosts often plot a reversal of personal fortunes, or the fortunes of their progeny or those of friends and allies. Others linger because they are not yet ready to reach their final fate.<br><br>Usually, prana ghosts are more helpful and less malicious than their ethereal cousins, but not always. A creature doesn’t need to have led a virtuous or enlightened life to achieve the state—it needs only the necessary force of will to slip the chains of death, and a willingness to accept whatever consequences its soul might have to endure for refusing to face judgment at the appointed time. The souls of evil creatures seeking final vengeance can be just as willful as those with righteous goals, for selfishness can drive a soul to cling to mortal existence as strongly as more noble motivations.<br><br>“Prana ghost” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with Intelligence and Wisdom scores of at least 6 (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A prana ghost retains all of the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 1.<br><br><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to outsider, and it gains the augmented, extraplanar, and incorporeal subtypes. Do not recalculate the creature’s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.<br><br><strong>Armor Class: </strong>A prana ghost gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom modifier instead of the Charismabased bonus the incorporeal ability normally provides. It loses the base creature’s armor bonus, as well as all armor and shield bonuses that don’t come from force effects or&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;items.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all of the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A prana ghost retains all of the defensive abilities of the base creature save those that rely on a corporeal form to function. Prana ghosts gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the incorporeal ability, and the rejuvenation ability.<br><br>Prana ghosts are immune to dazing, disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning, as well as all effects that require a corporeal body. They are not subject to nonlethal damage.<br><br>A prana ghost doesn’t risk death from damage, but instead immediately dissipates when its hit point total drops to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score. Prana ghosts are not affected by&nbsp;raise dead,&nbsp;resurrection, or&nbsp;true resurrection, but can be affected by&nbsp;reincarnate.<br><br><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em> In most cases, it is difficult to dissipate a prana ghost through simple combat; the prana ghost restores itself in 2d4 days. Generally, the only way to permanently dissipate a prana ghost is to help it complete its mission or to make the mission impossible to complete, after which the prana ghost continues its path to the afterlife.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A prana ghost gains the following weakness.&nbsp;Living</p>\n<p><em>Prana (Ex): </em>A prana ghost is made entirely of life essence, so it is vulnerable to effects that snuff life essence out. A prana ghost takes half again as much damage (+50%) from negative energy effects and death effects that deal damage, half again as many negative levels from negative energy effects that inflict negative levels, and half again as much Constitution damage and drain from negative energy effects (such as a wraith’s touch). If a prana ghost dissipates from such an effect, it takes twice as long for it to restore itself via rejuvenation.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Prana ghosts lose their previous speeds and gain a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) unless the base creature has a higher fly speed. They also gain the astral step ability.<br><br><em>Astral Step (Su):</em> As a standard action a number of times per day equal to its Wisdom bonus, a prana ghost can teleport to a space within 60 feet that it can see. This is a teleportation effect.<br><br><strong>Attacks: </strong>A prana ghost keeps the base creature’s natural and unarmed attacks. These attacks automatically count as if they had the ghost touch property and add the prana ghost’s Wisdom bonus to damage rolls (or 1/2 its Wisdom bonus for off-hand attacks and secondary weapons, but no additional damage for single primary natural attacks or the like). If the creature could wield weapons in life, it can wield&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;weapons as a prana ghost.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A prana ghost gains the following melee attack.<br><br><em>Dazing Touch (Su):</em> With a touch, a prana ghost can deal 1d6 points of damage, and the creature touched must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the prana ghost’s Hit Dice + the prana ghost’s Wisdom modifier) or be dazed for 1 round.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Dex +4, Con +4, Wis +2. As incorporeal creatures, prana ghosts have no Strength score.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Prana ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth skill checks. A prana ghost always treats Acrobatics, Bluff, Craft, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (planes), Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Use Magic Device as class skills. Otherwise, class skills are the same as the base creature.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> Prana ghosts gain Alertness, Improved Initiative, and Toughness as bonus feats.</p>"

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>While some liches prefer to spend undeath’s eternity in seclusion, a psychic lich sustains its life force by embracing its personal accomplishments to create a powerful astral echo of itself. Even more megalomaniacal than most liches, psychic liches resemble ordinary liches for the most part, but their every moment is attended by ghostly images of past cruelties, a constantly rotating illusory display of the evil deeds that brought them their power. Most psychic liches are humans, or come from other races renowned for their psychic abilities.</p>\n<h1>A Psychic Lich’s Memoir and Legend</h1>\n<p>To become a psychic lich, one must create and infuse a memoir, which serves a similar function to an ordinary lich’s phylactery. This memoir projects the lich’s personal legend into the Astral Plane, which is tethered through the planes to a physical object, typically a magically strengthened book or scroll (10 hit points, hardness 1, break DC 15). The only way to destroy the lich is to destroy his astral legend, which almost always requires the memoir as a special focus. Unless the astral legend is erased, the lich can rejuvenate after it is killed (see Creating a Psychic Lich, below).<br><br>Each psychic lich must create its own memoir by using the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast psychic spells at a caster level of 11th or higher. The memoir costs 120,000 gp to create and has a caster level equal to that of its creator at the time of creation.<br><br>If the physical memoir is destroyed while the psychic lich’s astral legend survives, the physical memoir gradually reforms over the course of 1d10 days at a site central to its creator’s history (such as the library where he first studied magic or the battlefield where he vanquished a powerful rival). It typically reappears hidden among other books or treasures, where an unwitting dupe might begin reading the text and hasten the psychic lich’s return.<br><br>“Psychic lich” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required astral memoir. A psychic lich retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A psychic lich gains darkvision 60 ft.<br><br><strong>Armor Class: </strong>A psychic lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature’s natural armor bonus, whichever is higher.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all of the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, psychic liches use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A psychic lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those abilities granted by its undead traits). The lich also gains the following two defensive abilities.<br><br><em>Psychic Feast (Ex):</em> If a psychic lich succeeds at a Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, it instead avoids the effect entirely. If the effect was a spell with the mind-affecting descriptor, the psychic lich also heals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus the spell’s caster level if it succeeds at its save. A psychic lich may automatically succeed on any Will save against a spell it casts that targets only itself.<br><br><em>Rejuvenation (Su):</em> When a psychic lich is destroyed, its body reforms near its astral memoir 10d10 days later. If a creature reads the psychic lich’s memoir, the total time is reduced to one tenth the original result, which could result in the psychic lich’s immediate restoration in a new body. Once the time elapses, the lich wakens fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body).<br><br>The only way to ensure that a psychic lich does not rejuvenate is to target its memoir with the spell instigate psychic duel or mindscape door or use it as a special focus when casting plane shift or similar magic. This allows one creature to instigate a psychic duel (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 202) on a veiled, harmful mindscape with a self-contained shape inhabited by the lich’s astral legend. The legend has the statistics of the lich, can’t leave the mindscape by any means, and is permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. An astral legend can’t be destroyed unless the psychic lich’s physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A psychic lich doesn’t gain immunity to mind-affecting effects as a result of becoming undead. If the base creature is immune to any mind-affecting effects, it loses those immunities and instead gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against such effects.<br><br><strong>Attacks: </strong>A psychic lich has a melee touch attack that it can use once per round as a natural weapon. A lich fighting without weapons uses its natural weapons (if it has any) in addition to its touch attack (which is treated as a primary natural weapon that replaces one claw or slam attack, if the creature has any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its weapons normally, and can use its touch attack as a secondary natural weapon.<br><br><strong>Damage:</strong> A psychic lich’s touch attack uses psychic energy to deal 1d8 points of damage to a target + 1 point of damage per 2 Hit Dice possessed by the lich. This energy has no effect on a creature immune to mind-affecting effects.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A psychic lich gains the special attacks described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the lich’s HD + the lich’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Bewildering Touch (Su): </em>Any living creature a psychic lich hits with its touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be permanently confused as its nervous system continuously sends false signals. The creature doesn’t automatically attack the psychic lich if it is targeted by further attacks.&nbsp;Calm emotions&nbsp;or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the&nbsp;bestow curse&nbsp;spell description) with a DC equal to the bewildering touch’s save DC. As a full-round action, a creature that rolls a result of “act normally” can attempt a new saving throw to end this effect.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a psychic lich has no Constitution score.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Psychic liches have a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A lich always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, skills are the same as the base creature.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> A psychic lich gains Psychic Combatant, and Psychic Defender as bonus feats, even if it does not meet the prerequisites.</p>"

		"Psychic Vampire": {
			"name": "Psychic Vampire",
			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template&nbsp;</strong>Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Much like their more bestial cousins, psychic vampires are undead abominations driven by a terrible hunger. However, unlike vampires and nosferatu, who feed on blood, psychic vampires hunger for the occult energy that fuels the spells of psychic spellcasters. Some scholars confuse psychic vampires with the rare vetala breed of vampires or call them “vetalaranas,” as they steal a more refined form of spiritual energy. For their part, psychic vampires consider vetalas a dying bloodline, and as their own influence increases, they strike against their corpse-possessing kin with impunity.<br><br>A psychic vampire is usually born when a creature with psychic potential dies in a state of denial, stubbornly clinging to the material world through sheer willpower. As it dies, the creature attempts to draw on its own psychic energy and that of any living beings around it in order to cling to its mortal existence. It inevitably fails, but if its will is strong enough, it rises again. No longer able to sustain itself using its own mental energy, it hungers for the energy of others. Psychic vampires can’t create spawn, and thus their numbers remain relatively small.<br><br>A hungry psychic vampire appears in shades of gray, but when it has gorged on psychic energy, it becomes flushed with natural colors once again, and if it’s careful, it might pass for a living creature. Although sunlight doesn’t harm psychic vampires, they avoid it because their unnatural grayness gives away their true nature. Religious mantras and superstitious antics have no effect on psychic vampires other than to amuse them greatly, although psychic vampires who were religious in life might expect those practices to hold power over them in their undead state and react with fear until they realize the mantras can’t harm them. The only thing that can give a psychic vampire pause is lack of fear in its victims.<br><br>The home of a psychic vampire looks deceptively normal, holding fresh food and other supplies that undead creatures don’t need in abundant supply. The fresh food is more than a facade, however; the psychic vampires have it fed to their captives to keep these captives fit for use as possessed bodies and reserves of psychic energy.<br><br>\"Psychic vampire\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most psychic vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A psychic vampire uses the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A psychic vampire gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet and thoughtsense.<br><br><strong>Armor Class: </strong>Natural armor improves by 4.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, psychic vampires use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A psychic vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/cold iron and magic, and resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A psychic vampire also gains fast healing 5. If the psychic vampire is reduced to 0 hit points in combat, its fast healing ceases to function, and it must possess an object (see Weaknesses below) as an immediate action or be utterly destroyed. While possessing the object, it can’t use any of its supernatural abilities or exit the object. If the possessed object is destroyed while the psychic vampire possesses it, the psychic vampire is permanently destroyed. After 1 hour, the psychic vampire can exit the possessed object, regain 1 hit point, and resume healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A psychic vampire has difficulty tolerating any vocal expressions that deny its power or authority. Any character can force a psychic vampire to recoil by dramatically defying it verbally as a standard action. This doesn’t harm the psychic vampire—it merely keeps the psychic vampire at bay. A recoiling psychic vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from an openly defiant character and can’t touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a psychic vampire can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.<br><br>Reducing a psychic vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see Defensive Abilities above). However, destroying an object possessed by a psychic vampire whose fast healing isn’t functioning destroys the psychic vampire forever. Repairing the object does not restore the psychic vampire.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A psychic vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn’t have one. Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A psychic vampire gains the following special attacks. The save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the psychic vampire’s Hit Dice + the psychic vampire’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Drain Psychic Energy (Su):</em> A creature hit by a psychic vampire’s slam attack (or other natural weapon) takes 1d4 points of ability drain to the highest of its mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), and the psychic vampire gains a like number of temporary points of psychic energy (PE). These PE points are in addition to the psychic vampire’s current PE total, and any PE expended is subtracted from these PE points first. These temporary PE points don’t stack with any previously gained temporary PE points. The temporary PE points disappear 1 hour later. The psychic vampire’s attack also drains the target’s memories, as per&nbsp;mindwipe. If a creature that takes ability damage from this attack has the ability to cast psychic spells, it is treated as though it were under the effects of a negative emotion effect for the purposes of the emotion component to its spellcasting. A successful Will saving throw negates all the effects of drain psychic energy.<br><br>This ability triggers only once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a psychic vampire makes.<br><br><em>Possession (Su): </em>As a full-round action, a psychic vampire can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature’s body, as per the spell&nbsp;possession&nbsp;(the CL is 10th or equal to the psychic vampire’s HD, whichever is higher). A creature that successfully saves against this ability is immune to that same psychic vampire’s possession for 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A psychic vampire gains the following special qualities.<br><br><em>Possess Object (Su):</em> As a full-round action, a psychic vampire can possess an object and animate it, as per&nbsp;object possessionOA, except the psychic vampire’s body vanishes while it’s possessing an object, as per&nbsp;greater possession. The psychic vampire can remain in control of an object indefinitely. The vampire’s presence in an object can be determined via divination spells such as&nbsp;detect evil&nbsp;and&nbsp;detect undead.<br><br><em>Psychic Magic (Su): </em>A psychic vampire gains the psychic magic universal monster rule (see page 2). The psychic vampire has a cumulative number of spells it can cast determined by its HD, with a CL equal to the psychic vampire’s HD. The psychic vampire’s PE pool is equal to its HD.</p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">HD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">5–8</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><em style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Burst of adrenaline</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(1 PE),&nbsp;<em>haste</em>&nbsp;(3 PE),&nbsp;<em>mental block</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(2 PE),&nbsp;<em>spider climb</em>&nbsp;(2 PE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">9–12</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><em style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Emotive block</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(3 PE),&nbsp;<em>mind thrust IV</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(4 PE),&nbsp;<em>riding possession</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(4 PE),&nbsp;<em>synaptic scramble</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(4 PE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">13–16</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><em style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Synapse overload</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(5 PE),&nbsp;<em>telepathy</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(5 PE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">17–20</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><em style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Ego whip IV</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(6 PE),&nbsp;<em>mass inflict pain</em><sup>OA</sup>&nbsp;(6 PE)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +2, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6.

Some say it is merely a dream of the gods, while others contend it is the realm of thought itself. Though it is a seemingly endless realm of celestial desert, creatures still roam and hunt on its infinite expanse.<br><br>Among the strangest are the psychoplasmic creatures that spontaneously form on the Astral Plane in no perceivable pattern. It could be that when a soul gets caught up in some form of astral eddy, its essence and the strange energies of the Astral Plane fuse to create this bizarre form of life. Some suggest that the passage of souls through the plane leaves impressions behind, the most powerful of which manifest as beings unto themselves. The most outlandish philosophies theorize that since the Astral Plane is a plane of thought, maybe a great thinker exists somewhere beyond the expanse, and these creatures are physical embodiments of its will.<br><br>Whatever the nature of a psychoplasmic creature’s genesis, it retains much of its knowledge of its former life, if any, but is extremely emotionally dulled. It cares nothing for its past, and instead takes on a mission or a task that it must complete, but usually without knowing why. Those who believe that the Astral Plane is both the incarnation of thought and also a thinker believe that these creatures always do the bidding of that astral mind. The evidence is scant, as there seems to be little rhyme or reason to individual psychoplasmic creatures’ actions. Instead, they seem inexplicably fixated on random things; while a few eventually change the nature of their obsessions, such refocusing is rare. Some of the most common tasks that psychoplasmic creatures propel themselves toward include hunting down beasts or beings that they never could have bested in life, exploring or drawing other creatures toward areas of the Astral Planes where few have ever tread, and giving themselves over to the service of psychic masters to whom they are inexplicably attuned.<br><br>The one common thread between all psychoplasmic creatures is their substance and appearance. Though they keep the forms they once held (or were molded to resemble), they seem to be composed of a large, constantly shifting clump of silvery dust. This dust continuously drifts from a psychoplasmic creature’s form, dissipating into nothing. Yet as fast as it falls, it is replaced, leaving the creature’s size unchanged even after decades or centuries of such evaporation. The strange dust of a psychoplasmic creature’s form completely disappears only after the creature fulfills its inscrutable objective.<br><br>Psychoplasmic creatures come in many forms. Many are large, hulking brutes that stalk those who invade or defile the Astral Plane, sometimes tracking trespassers to the Material Plane (though their mobility is diminished there). Others are more intelligent and serve as advisors and companions to shulsagas (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4</em>&nbsp;245). These beings might be treated as anything from valued members of a shulsaga community to embodiments of heroes or entire shulsaga tribes lost and reborn. Others, however, wage war on shulsagas, and are widely perceived as the psychic vengeance of deadly foes or mighty beasts from their mythology. In any case, the known power of psychoplasmic creatures has impacted shulsagas’ culture and art, and they dust many of their most sacred sites and most impressive pieces of statuary in silvery powder, to suggest suggesting the adaptability and might of psychoplasmic creatures.<br><br>A select few psychoplasmic creatures serve the interests of the Boneyard—though it can be difficult to tell whether that is intentional or incidental. Psychopomps keep these astral denizens at arm’s length, but nonetheless welcome their aid in their eternal vigil over the River of Souls. Many psychopomps remain skeptical of the strange creatures’ agenda, though, suspecting that these psychoplasmic allies are spying on or undermining their comrades. Regardless, no accounts tell of psychoplasmic creatures serving predators of souls, such as daemons.<br><br>Still other psychoplasmic creatures wander the planes, fixated on whatever was embedded in their minds when they came into being. A strange few seem to be born without any ambition beyond a nameless urge to wander the multiverse in search of adventure before they finally dissipate back into the silvery void of the Astral Plane.<br><br>“Psychoplasmic” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating</strong>: Base creature’s CR + 1.<br><br><strong>Alignment</strong>: Usually neutral.<br><br><strong>Type</strong>: The creature’s type changes to outsider.

Faced with this truth, most dragons vent their frustration on the countryside, ravaging the world before their passing. Yet some seek a greater solution to the problem and decide instead to linger on, hoarding life as they once hoarded gold. These foul wyrms attract the attention of dark powers, and through the blackest of necromantic rituals are transformed into undead dragons known as raveners.<br><br>Although its body quickly rots away, a ravener does not care for the needs of the flesh. It seeks only to consume life, be it from wild animals, would-be dragonslayers, or even other dragons. A ravener is often on the move, changing lairs frequently as its territories become devoid of life.<br><br>The ravener presented here is built from a red dragon wyrm.<br><br>“Ravener” is an acquired template that can be added to any evil true dragon of an age category of ancient or older (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A ravener retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. It keeps any subtypes possessed by the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>A ravener’s darkvision increases to 240 feet, and its blindsense increases to 120 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>A ravener gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to half its Charisma bonus (minimum +1).</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change all of the base creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As an undead, a ravener uses its Charisma to determine bonus hit points instead of its Constitution.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>As undead, a ravener uses its Charisma modifier on Fortitude saves (instead of Constitution).</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A ravener gains channel resistance +4 and all of the immunities derived from undead traits. Its damage reduction changes from DR/magic to DR/good. A ravener also gains the following ability.</p>\n<p><em>Soul Ward (Su): </em>An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a ravener from destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal to twice the ravener’s Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks: </strong>A ravener retains all of the natural attacks of the base creature, but each of these attacks threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Feats like Improved Critical can increase this range further. If the ravener scores a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target gains 1 negative level. The DC to remove this negative level is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener’s Hit Dice + the ravener’s Charisma modifier. Whenever a creature gains a negative level in this way, the ravener adds 5 points to its soul ward.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A ravener retains all of the special attacks of the base creature and gains the following special attacks as described below. All save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener’s HD + the ravener’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Breath Weapon (Su): </em>A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature—the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based. In addition, a ravener’s breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the area. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and reduces the energy drain to 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the ravener’s breath weapon DC. The ravener adds 1 hit point to its soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way.</p>\n<p><em>Cowering Fear (Su): </em>Any creature shaken by the ravener’s frightful presence is cowering instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken for the rest of the duration. Any creature that is panicked by its frightful presence is instead cowering for the duration.</p>\n<p><em>Soul Consumption (Su): </em>When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener dies, that creature’s soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener’s maw if the dying creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC of the ravener’s breath weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the ravener’s soul ward equal to the dead creature’s Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed in this way can only be brought back to life through&nbsp;miracle,&nbsp;true resurrection, or&nbsp;wish.</p>\n<p><em>Soul Magic (Sp): </em>A ravener retains the base creature’s spellcasting capability, adding three levels to the base creature’s caster level. This increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots. Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for metamagic feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it quickly).</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Str +4, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6. Being undead, a ravener has no Constitution score.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A ravener has a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth checks. The ravener’s class skills are otherwise the same as those of the base creature.</p>"

One foundation of the complex magical technique used to create sinspawn was known as runewarping. Through the use of runewarping, Alaznist and other powerful mages created horribly twisted creatures from their slaves and prisoners. These creators valued ability over aesthetics, so runewarped creatures were transformed by powerful magic into horrid mockeries of their previous forms. Runewarped creatures seek out sources of magic to consume, trying in vain to complete their transformation. Although a runewarped creature is recognizable as the creature it once was, the creature bears altered or additional limb joints, elongated fingers, and a massive jaw capable of delivering a powerful bite.<br><br>“Runewarped creature” is an acquired template that can be added to any animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template&nbsp;</strong>Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;Yes<br><br>This creature stares with cold, black eyes, its bluish-green skin slick with moisture and stinking of brine and the muck of the tidal flats. Its hands and feet are webbed, and its facial features are blunted by the smooth, frog-like skin that covers them. It makes no sound as it marches out of the shallows, water and seaweed streaming from its unkempt hair and barnacle-encrusted armor. It merely approaches with cold menace, sword raised and sharp beneath a crusting of salt.<br><br>During the troubled times following Andoran’s break with Cheliax, Chelish necromancers created the sea-sworn to fill the need for ruthless and overpowering marines who would serve the navy tirelessly. “Volunteered” by their captains, these sailors and warriors were forced to undergo hideous rites culminating in their dying and being reborn as undead monstrosities uniquely suited to making war at sea. Powerful swimmers without the need to breathe or eat, and nearly impossible to destroy in their natural element, these crack teams were the bane of Andoren ships, with just a handful of the fast-healing horrors capable of overrunning the mightiest frigates. Concerned that such effective troops might reach too far, the Chelish government ordered them anchored to their role with the “curse of the sea-sworn,” rendering them incapable of abandoning their ships or the sea. As further protection, the Chelish leaders frequently placed geas spells on the sea-sworn leaders, tasking them with policing their own and making sure that the undead sailors never strove to become more than what they were intended as: cold, heartless tools of Chelish ambition.<br><br><br></p>\n<h2>Creating a Sea-Sworn</h2>\n<p>“Sea-sworn” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature that does not possess the aquatic sub-type. A sea-sworn uses all of the base creature’s statistics except as noted here.<br><br><strong>Size and Type: </strong>The creature’s type changes to undead and it gains the augmented and aquatic sub-types. It retains any other subtypes except alignment subtypes. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class: </strong>The base creature’s natural armor bonus improves by +3. Sea-sworn often wear the armor they wore in life.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A sea-sworn retains the base creature’s defensive abilities and gains damage reduction.</p>\n<p><em>Damage Reduction (Ex): </em>A sea-sworn has damage reduction 5/piercing. Their skin is incredibly tough, but deep stabs allow their salt water essence to seep out.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>A sea-sworn retains the base creature’s weaknesses and gains the curse of the sea-sworn.</p>\n<p><em>Curse of the Sea-Sworn (Ex): </em>Sea-sworn function normally whenever in contact with salt water or aboard a vessel floating (or sunken) in salt water. A sea-sworn taken outside these conditions by any means quickly withers away, taking 2d6 points of damage per round.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>The creature gains a swim speed equal to its land speed, or retains its original swim speed if it is faster than its land speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks: </strong>A sea-sworn retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A sea-sworn also gains a slam attack that also inflicts its drowning touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage: </strong>Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the sea-sworn’s size. (Use the base creature’s slam damage if it’s better.)</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A sea-sworn retains the base creature’s special attacks and also gains the following.</p>\n<p><em>Drowning Touch (Ex): </em>The touch of a sea-sworn causes the lungs of a living creature to fill with salt water dealing 1 point of Constitution damage. Creatures with the aquatic or water sub-types, creatures that do not need to breathe, and creatures which can breathe water are all immune to this special attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Qualities: </strong>A sea-sworn loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A sea-sworn gains the following special quality.</p>\n<p><em>Fast Healing (Ex): </em>A sea-sworn gains fast healing 2 whenever it is immersed in salt water to a depth of at least one-quarter of the creature’s height.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>A sea-sworn’s Strength score increases by +4, it has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score decreases by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>Same as the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A sea-sworn has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Inherited<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Though the Great Old One Xhamen-Dor lies halfdormant where its bloated body crashed millennia ago, virtually nothing can prevent it from seeking new hosts to infect. The most common means by which one might contract this infestation is through nightmares that brush against Xhamen-Dor’s influence in the Dimension of Dreams, after which the Inmost Blot can track victims and infest their thoughts, slowly and painfully driving them mad. Less common is direct exposure to one of the Great Old One’s vine-choked thralls: the seeded.<br><br>Xhamen-Dor feeds upon a victim’s force of personality, and as a result, only a select few who meet its inscrutable criteria are even able to contract the seedborne consumption disease that turns one into a seeded. Those infected first become sickly and withdrawn. Weeks later, the germinating evil within begins sending fibrous feelers throughout the victim’s body. When the host finally slips into a catatonic coma, these fibers quickly digest the organs and portions of the flesh before animating the corpse from within like a puppet. Most victims maintain painful recollections of their former lives, yet they are driven to hear and obey the commands of Xhamen-Dor and find new victims to spread their plague.<br><br>“Seeded creature” is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal, living creature with a Charisma score of 12 or higher. A seeded creature uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 1.<br><br><strong>Alignment: </strong>Always neutral evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, Base Attack Bonus, or saves.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A seeded creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> The fungal growths that appear on a seeded creature’s body increase the base creature’s natural armor bonus by 2.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, seeded creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A seeded creature gains channel resistance +4, damage reduction 5/bludgeoning or slashing, a +4 bonus on saving throws against mindaffecting effects, cold resistance 10, and electricity resistance 10, in addition to the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A seeded creature also gains fast healing 5.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A seeded creature has the following weakness.<br><br><strong>Transformed:</strong> Although seeded creatures are undead, their bodies pulse with alien plant life. For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger’s favored enemy and bane weapons), seeded creatures count as both undead and plants.<br><br>Seeded creatures are not immune to charms, compulsions, and mind-affecting effects from psychic sources, such as psychic spells or a creature’s psychic magic ability. However, such effects have a chance to harm the source due to seeded creatures’ insidious mind special attack (see below).<br><br>Speed: A seeded creature retains all movement types and gains a climb speed equal to its base speed.<br><br><strong>Melee: </strong>A seeded creature gains two tendril attacks that each deal damage as per a tentacle of a creature one size category larger than the base creature’s size. These tendrils are secondary attacks and also have the grab universal monster ability, and the seeded creature’s reach with these attacks increases by 5 feet. Its natural weapons are treated as magic and evil weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A seeded creature gains several special attacks. The save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the seeded creature’s HD + the seeded creature’s Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Death Burst (Ex):</em> When a seeded creature dies, it releases psychic spores. All creatures adjacent to the seeded creature are exposed to its seedborne consumption infestation (see below). Due to the spores’ psychic nature, any effect that would completely deflect gases and similar airborne hazards grants protected creatures only a +5 bonus on saving throws against exposure.<br><br><em>Entrapping Tendrils (Ex): </em>When a seeded creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check to pin a foe, it can attempt a second combat maneuver check to tie up the foe with a tendril as a swift action. Doing so causes it to lose one of its tendril attacks as long as it is keeping a creature tied up in this way, and a seeded creature can tie up only two creatures in this way before it runs out of spare vines. Each round that a creature remains tied up in this way, it is exposed to the seeded one’s seedborne consumption until it is affected. In addition, every full day a victim remains tied up in this way is instead treated as though a month had passed for the purpose of the seedborne consumption disease. The tendrils each have hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If a creature tears free or destroys a tendril, the seeded creature regrows enough of the vines that make up its tendrils to regain its lost tendril attack after 1 minute.<br><br><em>Insidious Mind (Su): </em>When a seeded one succeeds at a saving throw against a psychic charm, a compulsion, or another mind-affecting spell or spell-like ability that would otherwise affect it, its dreams infect the spellcaster’s mind, exposing him to seedborne consumption.<br><br><em>Seedborne Consumption (Su):</em> natural or touch attack; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the seeded one’s HD + the seeded one’s Charisma modifier;&nbsp;onset&nbsp;1 month;&nbsp;frequency&nbsp;1/month;&nbsp;effect&nbsp;1d2 Charisma damage (this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected);&nbsp;cure&nbsp;3 consecutive saves. When a creature’s Charisma is reduced to 0, instead of becoming unconscious it falls into a feverish mental state where its mind is scattered and inattentive. The creature can still move and perform actions, but it can concentrate on only a single action, and for only a few moments. It takes a –4 penalty on saving throws; Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks; and skill checks. Within 24 hours of a creature’s Charisma score reaching 0, it dies and rises as a seeded creature.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Str +4, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a seeded creature has no Constitution score.<br><br><strong>Language:</strong> A seeded creature gains telepathy with a range of 100 feet, but only with other seeded creatures. Seeded creatures benefit from the morale bonuses granted by other seeded creatures within range of their telepathy.</p>"

Even in the face of overwhelming odds—an incursion of demons from the Abyss, a creeping plague of necromantic corruption, an unstoppable blight of magical radiation, or a similar supernatural threat to the natural world—some sects of druids refuse to give up or abandon their duties. In these tragic cases, the desperate druids adopt the blasphemous tactic of accepting the corruption into themselves and becoming powerful undead guardians. They fight on not only against the original source of the corruption, but against all living creatures, for these druids become siabraes, and are filled with bitterness and hatred for all others—particularly other druids, whom they regard as cowards. Siabraes do not form spontaneously; they arise only as the result of the horrific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/OccultRituals.aspx?ItemName=Welcome%20the%20Blighted%20Soul\">Welcome the Blighted Soul</a>&nbsp;ritual.<br><br>“Siabrae” is an acquired template that can be added to any druid who successfully performs the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/OccultRituals.aspx?ItemName=Welome%20the%20Blighted%20Soul\">welcome the blighted soul</a>&nbsp;ritual (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A siabrae can’t have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Druid%20Blight%20Druid\">blight druid</a>&nbsp;archetype. A siabrae retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment: </strong>Neutral evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead with the earth subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A siabrae gains darkvision and tremorsense, both with a range of 60 feet.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A siabrae has a +10 natural armor bonus or the creature’s normal bonus, whichever is better.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels are unchanged. As an undead, a siabrae uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (rather than using its Constitution modifier).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> In addition to all the abilities granted by its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Undead%20Traits\">undead traits</a>, a siabrae gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/ adamantine and bludgeoning, and immunity to fire. A siabrae also gains the following defensive ability.<br><br><em>Blighted Rebirth (Su):</em> When a siabrae is destroyed, it can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save in order to avoid this end. The siabrae automatically succeeds at this saving throw if it is in contact with blighted or diseased terrain. On a successful save, the siabrae’s body crumbles to dust as the blighted earth absorbs its essence. Its enduring essence begins forming a new body in a random location within 1d10 miles (this new location must contain a mass of unworked stone large enough for the siabrae’s body to form within). This process takes 1d10 days, after which the siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though without any of its gear.<br><br><strong>Speed: </strong>A siabrae gains a burrow speed equal to its land speed, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Earth%20Glide\">earth glide</a>&nbsp;ability.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A siabrae grows a pair of stony antlers from its skull, granting it a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Natural%20Attack\">gore attack that deals damage based on the siabrae’s size</a>, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. This gore attack is always a primary attack, even when the siabrae also uses weapons. If the siabrae wishes, it can retain these antlers in any form it assumes via wild shape. Shards of the stony antlers break off in wounds—a siabrae’s antlers constantly replenish themselves as these shards break off. A creature damaged by a siabrae’s gore attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the siabrae’s HD + the siabrae’s Charisma modifier) or turn to stone permanently.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks and Abilities:</strong> A siabrae retains all the special attacks and abilities of the base creature. If it had the ability to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Druid\">wild shape</a>, it retains this ability, but it can assume only the form of creatures that cannot fly. Any form it assumes (via wild shape or polymorph effects) and any creature it summons appears diseased, malnourished, or even in an advanced state of decay, although these are cosmetic effects; they do not impact actual game statistics. In addition, a siabrae gains the following special attacks.<br><br><em>Blight Mastery (Su):</em> Any of a siabrae’s spells or effects that would normally be restricted to affecting animals can also affect undead animals.<br><br><em>Blightbond (Ex):</em> A siabrae has an unholy bond with the blighted earth. It loses any animal companion or access to domains it had from its druidic nature bond ability.

A siabrae always treats Intimidate, Knowledge (planes), Knowledge (religion), Sense Motive, and Stealth as class skills.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Silverblood werewolves are a rare type of lycanthrope found almost exclusively in the Arthfell Forest. They are the survivors of an experimental process conceived by jeweler-turned-werewolf Garrick Argentum, and developed by his allies in the Shadow Pack, a group of werewolf druids in the forest. The Shadow Pack conducted an eldritch ritual involving successive exposures to pure silver under the light of the full moon in an attempt to desensitize the werewolves to the deadly touch of silver (in theory, this process could also produce other types of silverblood lycanthropes). The experiment was a success, and the werewolves lost their vulnerability. Swollen with pride at their new ability, the Shadow Pack joined forces with the hobgoblins of the wood and attacked the town of Olfden. Turned back after a savage battle known as the Night of Silver Blood, the werewolves sought to regroup and prepare a new assault, but on the night of the next new moon they discovered a fatal flaw in their blasphemous rite. Tied now more than ever to the lunar cycle, most of the silverblood werewolves wasted away and died when the moon darkened. Even those few that survived are greatly weakened when each new moon comes, though the surge of power when the moon waxes full still earns them great respect, and many have found positions of leadership among the werewolves of the wood.<br><br>Though the Night of Silver Blood was a failure, many hobgoblins and werewolves within the Arthfell Forest believe it is proof that major towns and even small cities could be totally ravaged by a somewhat larger, betterprepared force spearheaded by silverblood werewolves. Some groups of silverblood werewolves continue to maintain close connections to the local hobgoblins, forming war parties with them that raid farther and farther from the woods during the nights of the full moon. If one such band were to have a noteworthy success, its leaders might be able to gather a much larger force that could once again threaten Olfden or similarly sized settlements.<br><br>\"Silverblood lycanthrope\" is an acquired lycanthrope template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;196) that can be added to any humanoid or lycanthrope. If added to a creature that already has the lycanthrope template, it replaces that template.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating: </strong>Same as base creature +2 (this includes the +1 increase for being a natural lycanthrope).<br><br><strong>Size and Type:</strong> The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. The silverblood lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of the base animal. Its hybrid form is the same size as the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.<br><br><strong>AC:</strong> In animal or hybrid form the silverblood lycanthrope gains a +4 natural armor bonus to AC.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A silverblood lycanthrope gains DR 1/- in animal or hybrid form. When the moon is at least half full, this increases to DR 3/-, and during the nights of the full moon the silverblood lycanthrope gains DR 10/-.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.<br><br><strong>Melee: </strong>A lycanthrope gains a bite attack in animal and hybrid forms according to the base animal.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A silverblood lycanthrope retains all the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature. In animal or hybrid form it gains any special attacks associated with its natural weapons. A silverblood lycanthrope also gains low-light vision, scent, and the following abilities.<br><br><em>Change Shape (Su):</em> All silverblood lycanthropes have three forms: a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form when changing between humanoid and hybrid form, but does when changing between those forms and animal form. A silverblood lycanthrope can shift to any of its three forms as a move action. A slain silverblood lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead.<br><br><em>Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): </em>A silverblood lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the silverblood lycanthrope, this ability has no effect. Creatures that become lycanthropes as a result of this curse become standard afflicted lycanthropes rather than silverblood lycanthropes.<br><br><em>Lunar Sympathy (Su):</em> A silverblood lycanthrope is filled with enthusiastic vigor when the light of the moon is strongest. When the moon is at least half full, a silverblood lycanthrope gains the benefit of&nbsp;bless&nbsp;whenever it is outdoors at night. On nights of the full moon, a silverblood lycanthrope gains the effect of&nbsp;heroism&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;bless, and retains the benefit indoors.<br><br>When the moon is less than half full, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the night. On nights of the new moon, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes fatigued during the day and each night becomes exhausted and takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save reduces the Constitution damage by half.<br><br><em>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex):</em> In any form, silverblood lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with animals of the same species as the base animal. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Due to their near-legendary reputation, silverblood lycanthropes gain a +8 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against standard lycanthropes of the same base creature.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> +2 Wis, -2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con in hybrid and animal forms. Silverblood lycanthropes have enhanced senses but are not fully in control of their emotions and animalistic urges. In addition to these adjustments to the base creature's statistics, a silverblood lycanthrope's ability scores change when she assumes animal or hybrid form. In human form, the silverblood lycanthrope's ability scores are unchanged from the base creature's form. In animal and hybrid forms, the silverblood lycanthrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base animal's, whichever ability score is higher.</p>"

Instead, taxidermic creatures possess a rudimentary form of instinct, though they are still able to follow basic instructions from their creators.<br><br>Less refined than the magic used to animate undead, golems, and other constructs, the creation of a taxidermic creature is at best an inaccurate science.

Every creature crafted in such a manner is prone to inherent defects based on the materials used or shortcuts taken during the process, and may or may not be able to obey its creators commands in a satisfactory manner. Because of taxidermic creatures’ limited mental faculties, their creators must be extremely careful and literal when commanding them.<br><br>Left unattended, taxidermic creatures stand in place, having no need to drink, eat, or sleep.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Inherited<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Tulpas are constructed of ideas and imagination. Beings of pure thought (some theorize that they are made of the same mysterious substance as the Astral Plane), tulpas are made physical by a powerful mind that is either psychically attuned or has some amount of latent psychic power.<br><br>The exact process that creates a tulpa is not well understood. Sometimes such beings come about after years of practice and meditation followed by an occult ritual. Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and protect her from other potential dangers. While most of these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who created them, but just as many are malicious entities that subtly torment the child or lead her astray.<br><br>While a tulpa is a creature of thought created by the imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of its own. This often leads to conflict between a tulpa and its creator. In order to protect itself from banishment or worse, a tulpa often attempts to compel others to think and concentrate on its existence. This allows the tulpa to create havens of other “creators” in case its original creator forgets about the tulpa or becomes incapacitated. Nonetheless, even a sadistic tulpa or a tulpa with an actively belligerent creator must protect its creator’s life in order to preserve its own existence.<br><br>“Tulpa” is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature. Most tulpas take the form of humanoids, and most of those take the form of their creator, but these creatures can be nearly anything their creator imagines. Tulpas have a strangely parallel existence with unfettered eidolons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 110), and tulpas with a particularly bizarre form not based on an original creature can be represented as unfettered eidolons instead. A tulpa uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here. A tulpa can be created either intentionally or unintentionally, and this distinction affects the way the template applies to the base creature.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Tulpas can have any alignment, and their alignments vary wildly. An intentionally created tulpa’s creator can choose the tulpa’s alignment. Unintentionally created tulpas can be of any alignment, though in general an unintentionally created tulpa’s alignment is in opposition to that of the creature who created it. Tulpas often have alignments that are different from the base creature they resemble—they may manifest as a friendly red dragon, a nightmarishly evil unicorn, or a fun-loving prankster inevitable.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to outsider with the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate the creature’s Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> As a being of mental energy, tulpas naturally resist mental attacks. It gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws to resist mind-affecting effects.<br><br><strong>Psychic Magic: </strong>A tulpa is able to use a limited amount of psychic magic, though only to affect itself or its creator. The tulpa can store a maximum amount of psychic energy equal to 3 + its Hit Dice. The tulpa can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=burst%20of%20adrenaline\">burst of adrenaline</a>&nbsp;(1 PE),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=burst%20of%20insight\">burst of insight</a>&nbsp;(1 PE),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=ego%20whip%20I\">ego whip I</a>&nbsp;(3 PE),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=levitate\">levitate</a>&nbsp;(2 PE), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=paranoia\">paranoia</a>&nbsp;(2 PE) as psychic magic spells.

By concentrating for 1 minute, the tulpa can sense the direction and relative distance of its creator, as long as they are both on the same plane.<br><br><em>Mental Form (Su): </em>A tulpa is capable of existing in an entirely mental state, ceasing to exist as a physical creature and taking refuge within its creator’s mind. The tulpa can attempt to enter this mental form as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity as long as it is within 60 feet of its creator. The tulpa’s creator may attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the tulpa’s Hit Dice + the tulpa’s Intelligence modifier) to prevent it from entering the creator’s mind with this ability. If the creator succeeds at the saving throw, she cannot be affected by this ability for 24 hours. While in its mental form, the tulpa’s physical body ceases to exist, and it cannot be affected by attacks, spells, or other abilities. It perceives everything that its creator perceives (and is limited to the senses that its creator possesses, rather than using its own senses). While the tulpa is in its mental form, it is treated as though under the effects of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=riding%20possession\">riding possession</a>&nbsp;spell, although the effect lasts indefinitely, and the creator does not gain another saving throw if the tulpa casts a mind-affecting spell on the creator. The tulpa is also able to read its creator’s surface thoughts, as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect%20thoughts\">detect thoughts</a>&nbsp;spell, but the creator does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creator can attempt to force the tulpa out once per day with a new Will save. A tulpa that leaves its mental state appears in an unoccupied space of its choice within 60 feet of its creator.<br><br><em>Sustained by Thought (Su): </em>Tulpas sustain themselves on and gain their power from the mental energy of living creatures concentrating on the tulpa itself. Tulpas do not heal or regain psychic energy naturally. Instead, whenever a living creature spends at least 10 minutes mentally picturing the tulpa, or interacting with it in some way, the tulpa heals 5 hit points and gains 1 point of psychic energy. A creature other than its creator can’t provide more than 5 hit points and 1 PE to the tulpa per day with this activity, but its creator can feed its tulpa indefinitely, granting 5 hit points and 1 PE for every 10 minutes she spends in this way, up to the tulpa’s maximum hit points and PE.<br><br>A creature that regularly spends time mentally picturing or interacting with the tulpa may eventually forge a powerful link with the tulpa, and effectively be treated as though she is the tulpa’s creator (though this does not supplant the original creator or other creatures treated as the creator by use of this ability). A creature other than the creator that focuses on the tulpa enough to provide it with psychic energy each day for 7 consecutive days must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or forge such a link. Even when killed, a tulpa is not truly banished as long as its original creator still lives. Most tulpas come back to their creator within a month of the tulpa’s physical death.<br><br>If a tulpa’s original creator dies, so does the tulpa. The original creator can also get rid of a tulpa either by completing an occult quest, the details of which are specific to the creator and its tulpa, or by means of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=wish\">wish</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=miracle\">miracle</a>.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Tulpas know their creators’ minds extremely well and are adept at manipulating them. They gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against their creators.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> When a tulpa comes into being intentionally, its creator chooses two of the tulpa’s ability scores to increase by 4, and two of its ability scores to increase by 2 (These can be chosen under the \"Changes\" tab of this window). Otherwise, the ability scores increase randomly. Either way, the tulpa’s Intelligence score cannot exceed the Intelligence score of its creator, so if its Intelligence score would be higher than its creator’s, reduce its Intelligence to be the same as its creator’s instead (an unintentionally created tulpa already at maximum Intelligence never randomly gains an ability score increase to its Intelligence score).</p>"

Scholars studying the behavior and organization of the unknown speculate they may have originally been fey creatures that somehow reached the Dimension of Dreams and became trapped there, remade by other minds likewise lost in ephemeral dreamscapes. The unknown propagate more of their own kind by eroding humanoids’ psyches until the victims transform into new unknown. Unknown typically choose to victimize those who are already relatively helpless, especially children, but when they transform an accomplished adventurer into one of their own, the result can be truly terrifying.<br><br>“Unknown” is an acquired template for any humanoid. Unknown use the base creature abilities, except as noted.<br><br><strong>Challenge Rating:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment:</strong> Neutral evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to fey (augmented humanoid). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> An unknown gains low-light vision.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor bonus improves by 2.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> An unknown gains DR 10/cold iron.<br><br><strong>Melee</strong>: An unknown gains two claw attacks (assuming the base creature has two hands). These claws deal 1d6 points of damage if the unknown is Medium (1d4 if Small).<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> An unknown gains the following special attacks.<br><br><em>Psyche Erosion (Su):</em> Once per day, a target affected by an unknown’s victimize ability that sees the unknown’s true appearance must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the unknown’s total Hit Dice + the unknown’s Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of Charisma damage. A successful save negates the Charisma damage and also ends the unknown’s victimize effect on that target. As long as a creature is the target of an unknown’s victimize ability, it can’t recover the ability damage from psyche erosion, even through magic. If the Charisma damage from psyche erosion is equal to the target’s Charisma score, that creature doesn’t recover ability score damage naturally even if it ceases being the target of victimize. Only magic can fully heal this ability damage.<br><br>When its Charisma damage is equal to its Charisma score, the target falls into a nightmare-filled catatonia where it continues to be followed by an unknown. This dream state lasts for 1d4 days, and at the end, the character awakes if its Charisma damage has been reduced to less than its Charisma score. If not, the creature immediately loses all sense of self, becoming an unknown thrall. It replaces its Charisma score with the unknown’s Charisma score, and no longer takes Charisma damage from exposure to the unknown. Over time, typically 1 to 2 weeks, the thrall becomes a new unknown, gaining this template.<br><br>The unknown can share its senses with any of its thralls (even if it changes the target of its victimize ability), and as a full-round action, it can assume control of a thrall’s body, as per&nbsp;possessionOA. Typically, an unknown uses this ability to keep the thrall close by until it becomes an unknown. Unknowns often use thralls to lure new victims to its lair.<br><br>Psyche erosion is a mind-affecting effect. If your game uses the sanity system (see page 12), the erosion deals 2d6 points of sanity damage instead of Charisma damage, and triggers the catatonia and the transformation into a thrall if the victim’s sanity damage is equal to or exceeds the target’s sanity.<br><br><em>Victimize (Su):</em> As a swift action, an unknown can target a single creature within line of sight with this ability. After designating a target, the unknown can’t change the target of this ability for 24 hours, or until the target dies or succeeds at its save against the unknown’s psyche erosion ability. An unknown always knows the exact location of a victimized creature and the shortest route to reach it, even if it is on another plane (similar to a combined discern location and find the path); this is a divination effect and can only be prevented by mind blank and similar effects. A creature can be the target of only one unknown’s victimize ability at a time, and an unknown can victimize only one creature at a time.<br><br><strong>Spell-Like Abilities: </strong>An unknown can use&nbsp;blur, ghost sound, ventriloquism, and&nbsp;vocal alterationUM&nbsp;(self only) as spell-like abilities at will, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice.<br><br><strong>Languages:</strong> An unknown gains Aklo as a bonus language. It can’t speak except by using its&nbsp;ventriloquism&nbsp;spell-like ability.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> An unknown gains the following.<br><br><em>Assume Likeness (Su)</em>: As a standard action while using hallucinatory camouflage, an unknown is able to disguise itself as a specific creature known to the target of its victimize ability. If the victimized creature succeeds at a Will save (at the same DC as in psyche erosion) it negates this effect, and the unknown can’t use this ability again for 24 hours or until it changes victims, whichever comes first. Otherwise, the unknown’s features and mannerisms change to match the creature known to its victim, granting it a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate this creature. Unlike hallucinatory camouflage, this ability works against the target of victimize. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.<br><br><em>Dream Movements (Su): </em>To the unknown, all worlds are tinted with the shades of nightmares from the Dimension of Dreams, allowing them to defy the laws of physics as they move as if in a dream. An unknown gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It can travel as if by&nbsp;dimension door&nbsp;as a move action at will, but only to enter or leave an area within line of sight of the target of its victimize ability. The victimized creature and the intended destination must both be within long range of the unknown.<br><br><em>Hallucinatory Camouflage (Su):</em> As long as an unknown is targeting a creature with its victimize ability, it hides its appearance behind a veil of illusions, appearing to be an unremarkable member of the victimized creature’s race to everyone except the target of victimize. A successful Will save (at the same DC as psyche erosion) allows a creature that interacts with the illusion to disbelieve the effect. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores:</strong> +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +4 Charisma.</span></p>"

Most vampires were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base creature’s stats and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature + 2.<br><br><strong>AL:</strong> Any evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A vampire gains darkvision 60 ft.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> Natural armor improves by +6.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A vampire gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don’t harm the vampire—they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.<br><br>Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so.<br><br>Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire equal to one-third of its maximum hit points—a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire’s heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running water.<br><br><strong>Melee:</strong> A vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn’t have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire’s size (see Natural Attacks). Its slam also causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A vampire gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 vampire’s HD + vampire’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Blood Drain (Su): </em>A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.<br><br><em>Children of the Night (Su):</em> Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.<br><br><em>Create Spawn (Su):</em> A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature type as the vampire’s base creature type. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.<br><br><em>Dominate (Su): </em>A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent’s will as a standard action.

The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM’s discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature types with this power.<br><br><em>Energy Drain (Su):</em> A creature hit by a vampire’s slam (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels.

Referred to as consciousness or psyche by some, the academics of Vudra— from where most vetalas hail—call this fundamental vital force prana. Regardless of their desire’s name, vetalas prey upon those who show creative promise, possess potent force of will, or seem destined for greatness, draining the most brilliant sources of mortal light to fuel their own unnatural embers. Their dark mastery of life force allows vetalas to possess corpses or even overwhelm the minds of living creatures. With these stolen masks and the resources of abducted lives, they work their foul wills.<br><br>Vetalas are said to be the spirits of children “born evil,” who never received burial rites upon their deaths. Sometimes one of these evil spirits takes hold of a corpse— not necessarily its own—which becomes its anchor to the mortal world. Such young souls seek out experiences and life energy, becoming as wicked as any other vampire as they endlessly indulge their profane, deathless desires.<br><br>“Vetala” is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vetalas use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A vetala gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and good, and resistance to fire 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vetala also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vetala is helpless and its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour. Additional damage dealt to the vetala has no effect. Its body might be subjected to any method of dismemberment or desecration, but after 1 hour—regardless of the state of its remains—it regains 1 hit point, is no longer helpless, and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses: </strong>Vetalas cannot tolerate the sound of prayers or religious mantras recited by those truly faithful to a good deity. Any character with a good-aligned deity can force a vetala to recoil by dramatically praying as a standard action. Praying doesn’t harm a vetala; it merely keeps the creature at bay. A recoiling vetala must stay at least 5 feet away from a praying character and cannot touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a vetala can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. The prayers of those who worship non-good deities or worship no deity have no effect on a vetala.<br><br>Reducing a vetala’s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it (see fast healing). However, consecrating the vetala’s remains and burying the body destroys it forever. A vetala’s body is considered consecrated if it is doused with a vial of holy water and buried, if it is buried in earth affected by the spell&nbsp;consecrate, or if&nbsp;bless,&nbsp;prayer, or a similar divine spell is cast upon it as it is being buried. Digging up a vetala’s corpse or profaning the area where it’s buried does not restore a buried vetala.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> Same as the base creature. A vetala also gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed.<br><br><strong>Melee: </strong>A vetala gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn’t have them. A vetala’s claw attacks do damage as a creature once size category larger (for example, a Medium vetala’s claw attack deals 1d6 points of damage). A vetala’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A vetala gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the vetala’s Hit Dice + the vetala’s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.<br><br><em>Drain Prana (Su):</em> A vetala can drain the mental vitality of a grappled opponent. If the vetala establishes or maintains a pin, it drains this energy, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Additionally, the victim is affected by the spell&nbsp;modify memory, as if the vetala had spent 5 minutes concentrating. The vetala gains perfect knowledge of any memory it chooses to eliminate using this ability. Vetalas often use this ability to prevent victims from remembering they’ve been attacked.<br><br><em>Malevolence (Su):</em> As a full-round action, a vetala can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature’s body, as the spell&nbsp;magic jar&nbsp;(caster level 10th or the vetala’s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vetala’s possession for 24 hours. If a creature fails its save, its consciousness and control of its body are subsumed as the vetala takes command of its body. The vetala can remain in control for a number of hours equal to its Charisma modifier or until it decides to end the possession. Whenever the possession ends or the host body is killed, the vetala’s consciousness instantly returns to its body, regardless of distance, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the vetala’s body has been destroyed or moved to another plane, the vetala’s consciousness is destroyed when the possession ends. While possessing another creature, the vetala’s body is empty and vulnerable, though it is instantly aware if its body is disturbed or takes damage.<br><br><em>Paralysis (Ex): </em>Any creature struck by a vetala’s claws must make a successful Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to this effect.<br><br><em>Possess Corpse (Su): </em>As a full-round action, a vetala can possess a Large or smaller corpse just as it can a living body. The vetala’s consciousness leaves its body and takes control of the corpse, animating it as either a skeleton or zombie (depending on its state of decay).

Only the medium of wax can so closely duplicate the transparency of skin. Often, creators use powerful magic to house an animating spirit within the wax model. A created waxwork creature obeys the commands of its creator. Rarely, a wax sculpture animates of it own accord—the result of nearby magic suffusing the wax or a lost spirit in search of a corporeal form.

Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they have 1 racial HD. As constructs, waxwork creatures gain additional hit points as noted in the following table.<br><br><strong>Saves:</strong> The creature’s base save bonuses are Fortitude +1/3 HD, Reflex +1/3 HD, and Will +1/3 HD.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> A waxwork creature loses the base creature’s defensive abilities. It gains waxen regeneration 5 (fire) and immunity to cold. If it has 11 or more HD, the waxen regeneration increases to 10 (fire). It also gains all of the standard immunities and traits possessed by constructs.<br><br><em>Waxen Regeneration (Su): </em>This ability functions like regeneration, except the waxwork creature has it without a Constitution score. A waxwork creature reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while its waxen regeneration is active; it ignores all damage dealt to it that would reduce its hit points below 0. Fire damage causes the waxwork creature’s regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack.<br><br><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> A waxwork creature is vulnerable to fire.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> A waxwork creature retains movement types, except as follows: It loses burrow and magical flight speeds. Winged waxwork creatures can fly, but maneuverability drops to clumsy. A waxwork creature floats and must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check each round to stay underwater.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A waxwork creature retains all the natural weapons and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the waxwork creature’s size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> A waxwork creature retains none of the base creature’s special attacks.<br><br><strong>Abilities:</strong> A waxwork creature has no Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10.<br><br><strong>BAB:</strong> A waxwork creature’s base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> A waxwork creature loses all of the base creature’s skills and gains none of its own.<br><br><strong>Feats:</strong> A waxwork creature loses all of the base creature’s feats and gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.<br><br><strong>Special Qualities:</strong> A waxwork creature loses most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. A waxwork creature gains the freeze universal monster ability to appear as a wax sculpture.</p>"

Willingly pledging themselves to a wholly evil life, these creatures undergo a complex ritual called the Winter Rite, in which they accept a sliver of ice into their hearts that infuses their bodies with the same supernatural winter perpetuated by the White Witches of Irrisen. The resulting transformation gives the fey’s skin a sickly bluish cast marked with spidery white veins like hoarfrost on glass. These evil fey can channel the power of winter into their attacks, slowing their victims with numbing cold. The winter-touched universally delight in spreading the influence of the White Witches, carrying out the wills of the witches who performed their Winter Rites. The winter-touched display a chilling loyalty that borders on fanaticism—a devotion all but guaranteed given the White Witches’ ability to fatally pierce the hearts of those who fail them with the same slivers of ice the fey so willingly accepted.<br><br><br></p>\n<h2>Winter-Touched Fey</h2>\n<p>The winter-touched fey simple template can be applied to any creature of the fey type.

			"description": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template&nbsp;</strong>No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and a remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with eldritch magic, a strange phenomenon sometimes occurs. The flesh of the decaying body fats and instructs the very worms that gnaw, and these graveworms quicken not only on corruption but upon the spellcaster’s memories and magical power. The spellcaster’s very soul is consumed in this vile process, only to be split apart to inhabit each of the individual chewing worms in so many fragments. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known as a worm that walks—a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence, and can wield the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but is not undead—it is a hideous new form of undulant life.<br><br>“Worm that walks” is a template that can be added to any evil spellcasting creature. A worm that walks retains all the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Same as the base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Any evil.</p>\n<p><strong>Type: </strong>The base creature’s type changes to vermin. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Worms that walk are intelligent and do not possess the standard mindless trait of most vermin. Note that while a worm that walks has the ability to discorperate into a swarm, and while its body is made up of countless wriggling worms, it does not itself gain the swarm subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>Size: </strong>Although the worms that make up the worm that walks’s body are Fine creatures, the worm that walks is treated as a creature the same size as the base creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>As the base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet and blindsight 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>AC: </strong>The worm that walks loses any natural armor bonus the base creature may have had, but gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom bonus (minimum of +2).</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change the base creature’s racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>A worm that walks retains all of the base creature’s defensive abilities and special qualities. It also gains the following additional defensive abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Worm that Walks Traits: </strong>A worm that walks has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate (see below)—a worm that walks at 0 hit points is staggered, and one at negative hit points is dying. Worms that walk are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as&nbsp;disintegrate), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by the worm that walks itself, which treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it so chooses. Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function normally against a worm that walks, since the creature’s individual components share a hive mind. A worm that walks takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects, such as&nbsp;fireball&nbsp;and splash weapons. Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds—treat a worm that walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Reduction: </strong>A worm that walks loses any damage reduction possessed by the base creature and gains damage reduction 15/—.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast Healing: </strong>A worm that walks gains fast healing equal to its CR.<br>Immunities: Worms that walk are immune to disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Melee Attacks: </strong>A worm that walks loses any natural attacks the base creature had, but gains a slam attack that deals damage based on its size (see Table 3–1: Natural Attacks by Size, on page 299). This slam has the grab ability and affects creatures up to one size larger than the worm that walks. A worm that walks retains any weapon proficiencies the base creature had.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A worm that walks retains all of the base creature’s special attacks. It also gains the following additional special attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Discorporate (Su)&nbsp;</em>A worm that walks can collapse into a shapeless swarm of worms &nbsp;as a free action. All held, worn, and carried items fall and its Strength score drops to 1. The worm that walks functions as a true swarm while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the worm that walks loses all of its defensive abilities and gains all of the standard swarm traits. It loses its slam attacks and all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that deals damage equal to its engulf attack. A worm that walks can reform into its true form (including equipping all gear in reach) as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.</p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">HD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Engulf Damage</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">1–5</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d6 + 1.5 Str bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">6–10</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2d6 + 1.5 Str bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">11–15</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3d6 + 1.5 Str bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">16–20</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">4d6 + 1.5 Str bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">21 or more</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">5d6 + 1.5 Str bonus</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Squirming Embrace (Ex)&nbsp;</em>If a worm that walks grapples a foe, as a swift action, it can cause a swarm of worms to squirm over the grappled creature.

If a creature takes damage from the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm’s distraction ability, and must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 the worm that walks’s HD + its Con modifier).</p>\n<p>A worm that walks can only have one embraced target at a time, but it does not have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the worm that walks moves more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the swarm (a free action), the swarm dies. Any area attack that damages the swarm or any severe or stronger wind effect that affects the swarm’s target kills it.</p>\n<p><em>Tenacious (Ex)&nbsp;</em>A worm that walks gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.</p>\n<p><strong>Abilities: </strong>Dex +4, Con +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Worms that walk gain a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats: </strong>Worms that walk gain Diehard as a bonus feat.</p>"
